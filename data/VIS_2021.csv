0,CACTUS: Detecting and Resolving Conflicts in Objective Functions,"Subhajit Das, Alex Endert","Machine learning (ML) models are constructed by expert ML practitioners using various coding languages, in which they tune and select model hyperparameters and learning algorithms for a given problem domain. In multi-objective optimization, conflicting objectives and constraints is a major area of concern. In such problems, several competing objectives are seen for which no single optimal solution is found that satisfies all desired objectives simultaneously. In the past, visual analytic (VA) systems have allowed users to interactively construct objective functions for a classifier. In this paper, we extend this line of work by prototyping a technique to visualize multi-objective objective functions either defined in a Jupyter notebook or defined using an interactive visual interface to help users to detect and resolve conflicting objectives. Visualization of the objective function enlightens potentially conflicting objectives that obstructs selecting correct solution(s) for the desired ML task or goal. We also present an enumeration of potential conflicts in objective specification in multi-objective objective functions for classifier selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach in a VA system that helps users in specifying meaningful objective functions to a classifier by detecting and resolving conflicting objectives.",,,VDS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vds-11008.html
1,Graph Comparison for Causal Discovery,"Joseph Cottam, Maria Glenski, Zhuanyi Huang, Ryan Rabello, Austin Golding, Svitlana Volkova, Dustin L Arendt","Reasoning about cause and effect is one of the frontiers for modern machine learning. Many causality techniques reason over a ``causal graph'' provided as input to the problem. When a causal graph cannot be produced from human expertise, ``causal discovery'' algorithms can be used to generate one from data. Unfortunately, causal discovery algorithms vary wildly in their results due to unrealistic data and modeling assumptions, so the results still need to be manually validated and adjusted. This paper presents a graph comparison tool designed to help analysts curate causal discovery results. This tool facilitates feedback loops whereby an analyst compares proposed graphs from multiple algorithms (or ensembles) and then uses insights from the comparison to refine parameters and inputs to the algorithms. We illustrate different types of comparisons and show how the interplay of causal discovery and graph comparison improves causal discovery.",,,VDS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vds-21006.html
2,Lodestar: Supporting Independent Learning and Rapid Experimentation Through Data-Driven Analysis Recommendations,"Deepthi Raghunandan, Zhe Cui, Kartik Krishnan, Segen Tirfe, Shenzhi Shi, Tejaswi Darshan Shrestha, Leilani Battle, Niklas Elmqvist","Keeping abreast of current trends, technologies, and best practices in visualization and data analysis is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for fledgling data scientists. In this paper, we propose Lodestar, an interactive computational notebook that allows users to quickly explore and construct new data science workflows by selecting from a list of automated analysis recommendations. We derive our recommendations from directed graphs of known analysis states, with two input sources: one manually curated from online data science tutorials, and another extracted through semi-automatic analysis of a corpus of over 6,000 Jupyter notebooks. We evaluate Lodestar in a formative study guiding our next set of improvements to the tool. The evaluation suggests that users find Lodestar useful for rapidly creating data science workflows.",,,VDS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vds-31005.html
3,Natto: Rapid Visual Iteration of Analytic Data Models with Intelligent Assistance,"Anamaria Crisan, Vidya Setlur","Data analysts need to routinely transform data into a form conducive for deeper investigation. While there exists a myriad of tools to support this task on tabular data, few tools exist to support analysts with more complex data types. In this study, we investigate how analysts process and transform large sets of XML data to create an analytic data model useful to further their analysis. We conduct a set of formative interviews with four experts that have diverse yet specialized knowledge of a common dataset. From these interviews, we derive a set of goals, tasks, and design requirements for transforming XML data into an analytic data model. We implement Natto as a proof-of-concept prototype that actualizes these design requirements into a set of visual and interaction design choices. We demonstrate the utility of the system through the presentation of analysis scenarios using real-world data. Our research contributes novel insights into the unique challenges of transforming data that is both hierarchical and internally linked. Further, it extends the knowledge of the visualization community in the areas of data preparation and wrangling.",,,VDS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vds-41007.html
4,A Multi-scale Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Biomedical Knowledge,"Fahd Husain, Rosa Romero-Gómez, Emily Kuang, Dario Segura, Adamo Carolli Carolli, Lai Chung Liu, Manfred Cheung, Yohann Paris","This paper describes an ongoing multi-scale visual analytics approach for exploring and analyzing biomedical knowledge at scale. We utilize global and local views, hierarchical and flow-based graph layouts, multi-faceted search, neighborhood recommendations, and document visualizations to help researchers interactively explore, query, and analyze biological graphs against the backdrop of biomedical knowledge. The generality of our approach - insofar as it re-quires only knowledge graphs linked to documents - means it can support a range of therapeutic use cases across different domains, from disease propagation to drug discovery. Early interactions with domain experts support our approach for use cases with graphs with over 40,000 nodes and 350,000 edges.",,,Introduction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vahc-1007.html
5,A Case Study of Using Analytic Provenance to Reconstruct User Trust in a Guided Visual Analytics System,"Nadia Boukhelifa, Evelyne Lutton, Anastasia Bezerianos","In this paper, we demonstrate how analytic provenance can be exploited to re-construct user trust in a guided Visual Analytics (VA) system, and suggest that interaction log data analysis can be a valuable tool for on-line trust monitoring. Our approach moves away from the subjective and often a-posteriori evaluations of user trust, towards more objective measures that are not only continuously tracked and updated, but also reflect both the confidence of the user in system suggestions, and the uncertainty of the system with regards to user goals. We argue that this approach is more suitable for guided visual analytics systems such as ours, where user strategies, goals and even trust can evolve over time, in reaction to new system feedback and insights from the exploration. Through the analysis of log data from a past user study with twelve participants performing a guided visual analysis task, we found that the stability of user exploration strategies is a promising factor to study “trust”. However, indirect metrics based on provenance, such as user evaluation counts and disagreement rates, are alone not sufficient to study trust reliably in guided VAs. We conclude with open challenges and opportunities for exploiting analytic provenance to support trust monitoring in guided VA systems.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-1418.html
6,The Enhanced Security in Process System - Evaluating Knowledge Assistance,"Anna-Pia Lohfink, Vera Marie Memmesheimer, Frederike Gartzky, Christoph Garth","We present evaluation results of our enhancements to the Security in Process System developed by Lohfink et al. to support triage analysis in operational technology networks. To ensure fast and appropriate reactions to anomalies in device readings, this system communicates anomaly detection results and device readings to incorporate human expertise and experience. It exploits periodical behavior in the data combining spiral plots with results from anomaly detection. To support decisions, increase trust, and support cooperation in the system we enhanced it to be knowledge-assisted. A central knowledge base allows sharing knowledge between users and support during analysis. It consists of an ontology describing incidents, and a data base holding collections of exemplary sensor readings with annotations and visualization parameters. Related knowledge is proposed automatically and incorporated directly in the visualization to provide assistance that is closely coupled to the application, without additional hurdles. This integration is designed aiming on additional support for correct and fast detection of anomalies in the visualized device readings. We evaluate our enhancements to the Security in Process System in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and cognitive load with a detailed user study. Comparing the original and enhanced system, we are able to draw conclusions as to how our design narrows the knowledge gap between experts and laymen. Furthermore, we present and discuss the results and impact on our future research.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-8188.html
7,Making and Trusting Decisions in Visual Analytics,Wenkai Han,"Decision making and trust have both become rising topics in the research community of Visual Analytics (VA).
Many efforts have been made to understand and facilitate making decisions with VA, as well as build and calibrate trust.
However, previous research largely took VA as a tool to facilitate decision making, but did not explore the possibility to dissect each analytical step in VA as decision making and discuss how decision making theories can be utilized to improve the trustworthiness of decisions in VA.
Therefore, this paper instead proposes such alternative take on the relation between decision making and VA, inspects the processes of visually analyzing data as decision making, and discusses how to leverage decision making theories to facilitate trustworthy decision making in VA.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-8311.html
8,Beyond Visual Analytics: Human-Machine Teaming for AI-Driven Data Sensemaking,"John Wenskovitch, Corey Fallon, Kate Miller, Aritra Dasgupta","“Detect the expected, discover the unexpected” was the founding principle of the field of visual analytics. This mantra implies human stakeholders, like a domain expert or data analyst, could leverage visual analytics techniques to seek answers to known unknowns and discover unknown unknowns in the course of the data sensemaking process. We argue that in the era of AI-driven automation, the roles of humans and machines (e.g., a machine learning model) need to be recalibrated in terms of a team. We posit that by realizing human-machine teams as a stakeholder unit, we can better achieve the best of both worlds: automation transparency and human reasoning efficacy. However, this also increases the burden on analysts and domain experts towards performing more cognitively demanding tasks than they are used to. In this paper, we reflect on the complementary roles in a human-machine team through the lens of cognitive psychology and map them to existing and emerging research in the visual analytics community. We discuss open questions around the nature of human agency and analyze the shared responsibilities in human-machine teams.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-5186.html
9,"Evaluating Forecasting, Knowledge, and Visual Analytics","Yafeng Lu, Michael Steptoe, Verica Buchanan, Nancy Cooke, Ross Maciejewski","In this paper, we explore the intersection of knowledge and the forecasting accuracy of humans when supported by visual analytics. We have recruited 40 experts in machine learning and trained them in the use of a box office forecasting visual analytics system.
Our goal was to explore the impact of visual analytics and knowledge in human-machine forecasting. This paper reports on how participants explore and reason with data and develop a forecast when provided with a predictive model of middling performance ($R^2 \approx .7$). We vary the knowledge base of the participants through training, compare the forecasts to the baseline model, and discuss performance in the context of previous work on algorithmic aversion and trust.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-6127.html
10,Time Series Model Attribution Visualizations as Explanations,"Udo Schlegel, Daniel Keim","Attributions are a common local explanation technique for deep learning models on single samples as they are easily extractable and demonstrate the relevance of input values.
In many cases, heatmaps visualize such attributions for samples, for instance, on images.
However, heatmaps are not always the ideal visualization to explain certain model decisions for other data types.
In this survey, we focus on attribution visualizations for time series.
We collect attribution heatmap visualizations and some alternatives, discuss the advantages as well as disadvantages and give a short position towards future opportunities for attributions and explanations for time series.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-1899.html
11,Trust in Prediction Models: a Mixed-Methods Pilot Study on the Impact of Domain Expertise,"Jeroen Ooge, Katrien Verbert","Users' trust in prediction models can be affected by many factors, including domain knowledge and experience with predictive modelling. However, it is not entirely clear to what extent and why this domain expertise impacts users' trust perceptions and evolutions. In addition, it remains challenging to accurately measure users' trust. We share our results and experiences of an exploratory case-study with a visual analytics system that incorporates a prediction model for time series. Through a mixed-methods approach involving Likert-type questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, we investigate users' trust evolutions and factors that affect their trust in the prediction model. Our results underline the multi-faceted nature of user trust, and suggest that domain expertise certainly affects trust, though it cannot fully foresee users' trust evolutions.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-8523.html
12,Should I Follow this Model? The Effect of Uncertainty Visualization on the Acceptance of Time Series Forecasts,"Dirk Leffrang, Oliver Mueller","Time series forecasts are ubiquitous, ranging from daily weather forecasts to projections of pandemics such as COVID-19. Communicating the uncertainty associated with such forecasts is important, because it may affect users' trust in a forecasting model and, in turn, the decisions made based on the model. Although there exists a growing body of research on visualizing uncertainty in general, the important case of visualizing prediction uncertainty in time series forecasting has not been studied yet. Against this background, we investigated how different visualizations of predictive uncertainty affect the extent to which people follow predictions of a time series forecasting model. More specifically, we conducted an online experiment on forecasting occupied hospital beds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring the influence of uncertainty visualization of algorithmic predictions on participants' own predictions. In contrast to prior studies, our empirical results suggest that more salient visualizations of uncertainty lead to decreased willingness to follow algorithmic forecasts.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-2998.html
13,How to deal with Uncertainty in Machine Learning for Medical Applications?,"Christina Gillmann, Dorothee Saur, Gerik Scheuermann","Recently, machine learning is massively on the rise in medical applications providing the ability to predict diseases, plan treatment, and monitor progress. Still, the use in a clinical context of this technology is rather rare, mostly due to the missing trust of clinicians. In this position paper, we aim to show how uncertainty is introduced in the machine learning process when applying it to the medical do-main at multiple points and how this influences the decision-making process of clinicians in machine learning approaches. Based on this knowledge, we aim to refine the guidelines for trust in visual analytics to assist clinicians in using and understanding systems that are based on machine learning.",,,TREX: Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-trex-8391.html
14,Towards a Comprehensive Cohort Visualization of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Salmah Ahmad, David Sessler, Jörn Kohlhammer","This paper reports on a joint project with medical experts on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients suffering from IBD, e.g. Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, do not have a reduced life expectancy and disease progressions easily span several decades. We designed a visualization to highlight information that is vital for comparing patients and progressions, especially with respect to the treatments administered over the years. Medical experts can interactively determine the amount of information displayed and can synchronize the progressions to the beginning of certain treatments and medications. While the visualization was designed in close collaboration with IBD experts, we additionally evaluated our approach with 35 participants to ensure good usability and accessibility. The paper also highlights the future work on similarity definition and additional visual features in this on-going project.",,,Clinical and Medical Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vahc-1003.html
15,Phoenix Virtual Heart: A Hybrid VR-Desktop Visualization System for Cardiac Surgery Planning and Education,"Jinbin Huang, Jonathan Douglas Plasencia, Dianna M.E. Bardo, Nicholas C. Rubert, Erik G. Ellsworth, Steven D. Zangwill, Chris Bryan","Physicians diagnosing and treating complex, structural congenital heart disease (CHD), i.e., heart defects present at birth, often rely on visualization software that scrolls through a volume stack of two-dimensional (2D) medical images. Due to limited display dimensions, conventional desktop-based applications have difficulties facilitating physicians converting 2D images to 3D intelligence. Recently, 3D printing of anatomical models has emerged as a technique to analyze CHD, but current workflows are tedious. To this end, we introduce and describe our ongoing work developing the Phoenix Virtual Heart (PVH), a hybrid VR-desktop software to aid in CHD surgical planning and family consultation. PVH is currently being integrated into a 3D printing workflow at a children's hospital as a way to increase physician efficiency and confidence, allowing physicians to analyze virtual anatomical models for surgical planning and family consultation.",,,Clinical and Medical Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vahc-1009.html

Perlis, Finale Doshi-Velez, Prof. Elena L. Glassman","It is challenging to visualize temporal patterns in electronic health records (EHRs) due to the high volume and high dimensionality of EHRs. In this paper, we conduct a formative study with three clinical researchers to understand their needs of exploring temporal patterns in EHRs. Based on those insights, we develop a new visualization interface that renders medical event trajectories in a holistic timeline view and guides users towards interesting patterns using an information scent based method. We demonstrate how a clinical researcher can use our tool to discover interesting sub-cohorts with unique disease progression and treatment trajectories in a case study.",,,Clinical and Medical Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vahc-1010.html

analysis by users external to the team. Theoretical issues around
bridging the gap between approaches adopted for small and/or
large-scale datasets are addressed from functional perspectives
with reference to evolving data modelling and software

19,Paper 2: Uncertainty-aware Topic Modeling Visualization,"Valerie Mü̈ller, Christian Sieg, Lars Linsen","Topic modeling is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing text
corpora. It uses a statistical model, most commonly Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), to discover abstract topics that occur in the document collection. However, the LDA-based topic modeling procedure
is based on a randomly selected initial configuration as well as a
number of parameter values than need to be chosen. This induces
uncertainties on the topic modeling results, and visualization methods should convey these uncertainties during the analysis process.
We propose a visual uncertainty-aware topic modeling analysis. We
capture the uncertainty by computing topic modeling ensembles and
propose measures for estimating topic modeling uncertainty from
the ensemble. Then, we propose to enhance state-of-the-art topic
modeling visualization methods to convey the uncertainty in the
topic modeling process. We visualize the entire ensemble of topic
modeling results at different levels for topic and document analysis.
We apply our visualization methods to a text corpus to document the
impact of uncertainty on the analysis.",,,Papers & Provocations I,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vis4dh-1014.html

30,COVID-19 EnsembleVis: Visual Analysis of County-level Ensemble Forecast Models,"Sanjana Srabanti, G. Elisabeta Marai, Fabio Miranda","The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its contagious disease COVID-19 has impacted countries to an extent not seen since the 1918 flu pandemic. In the absence of an effective vaccine and as cases surge worldwide, governments were forced to adopt measures to inhibit the spread of the disease. To reduce its impact and to guide policy planning and resource allocation, researchers have been developing models to forecast the infectious disease. Ensemble models, by aggregating forecasts from multiple individual models, have been shown to be a useful forecasting method. However, these models can still provide less-than-adequate forecasts at higher spatial resolutions. In this paper, we built COVID-19 EnsembleVis, a web-based interactive visual interface that allows the assessment of the errors of ensembles and individual models by enabling users to effortlessly navigate through and compare the outputs of models considering their space and time dimensions.

The Ohio Children’s Opportunity Index (OCOI) is a multi-dimensional area-level opportunity index comprised of eight health dimensions. Our research team has documented the design, development, and use cases of dashboard solutions to visualize OCOI. The OCOI is a multi-dimensional index spanning the following eight domains or dimensions: family stability, infant health, children’s health, access, education, housing, environment, and criminal justice. Information on these eight domains is derived from the American Community Survey and other administrative datasets maintained by the state of Ohio. Our team used the Tableau Desktop visualization software and applied a user-centered design approach to developing the two OCOI dashboards— main OCOI dashboard and OCOI-race dashboard. We also performed convergence analysis to visualize the census tracts, where different health indicators simultaneously exist at their worst levels. The OCOI dashboards have multiple, interactive components: a choropleth map of Ohio displaying OCOI scores for a specific census tract, graphs presenting OCOI or domain scores to compare relative positions for tracts, and a sortable table to visualize scores for specific county and census tracts. Stakeholders provided iterative feedback on dashboard design in regard to functionality, content, and aesthetics. A case study using the two dashboards for convergence analysis revealed census tracts in neighborhoods with low infant health scores and a high proportion of minority population. The OCOI dashboards could assist end-users in making decisions that tailor health care delivery and policy decision-making regarding children’s health particularly in areas where multiple health indicators exist at their worst levels.",,,COVID-19 and Public Health Dashboards,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vahc-1019.html
32,Unfolding the Decision-Making Dynamics of News Visualization Production in China,Qian Ma,"News visualization is a journalistic form that centers on delivering information through data visualizations. It is arousing the interest of journalism professionals and scholars worldwide, including those in non-western societies. Limited studies have identified the challenges and opportunities of news visualization's adoption in non-western newsrooms, but the professionals' considerations and actions to deal with these challenges and seize the opportunities are unknown. This study explores the criteria for a valuable news visualization and how professionals balance the criteria and constraints to make news decisions in the newsrooms in China. A grounded analysis drawing on 15 in-depth interviews with professionals reveals the dynamics of source selection, interpretation, and presentation in news visualization production. It also shows that news visualization stories result from the debating and tradeoffs between the ""western norms"" and the organization's expectations, audiences' preferences, news commercialization, and macro environment in China.",,,Fourth Workshop on Visualization for Communication (VisComm),,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_w-viscomm-1015.html

Without the feedback provided by synchronous sessions, however, instructors may lack ongoing insight into students’ progress and performance in fully asynchronous online offerings. Providing greater visibility into students’ online learning behavior has several potential benefits: 1) teachers who seek to provide live sessions that depend on knowledge from asynchronous resources will have a better gauge of students’ preparation; 2) enhanced understanding of the relationship between student pacing and performance can help teachers and researchers characterize the impact of timely engagement with online course material; 3) providing a means of monitoring the effect of changes in course structure or incentives may guide course designers/planners in continuous improvement; and 4) visualizations that illustrate the relationship between students’ course progress and performance have the promise of allowing teachers to take steps early to positively affect students’ outcomes.

pursued by researchers in digital humanities, specifically working
in virtual displays of artwork, the design of the Virtual Rosetta,
including text readability, wall and text contrast, and organization
of drawings, as well as the associated results. We used an analysis technique known as hierarchical clustering utilizing sentence
embeddings, a technique in natural language processing in which
sentences are mapped to numerical vectors, to organize a subset
of the drawings so that drawings with similar text descriptions are
located near each other. Performing this on an entire dataset would
allow humanities researchers to most effectively and efficiently visualize their findings. We report on user experience and efficacy for a
number of virtual environment layouts for displaying drawings and

48,Simultaneous Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections,"Nathan van Beusekom, Wouter Meulemans, Bettina Speckmann","Undirected graphs are frequently used to model phenomena that deal with interacting objects, such as social networks, brain activity and communication networks. The topology of an undirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization crucially depends on the ordering of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.
  
  Often, graphs do not exist in isolation but as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of vertices, for example, brain scans over time or of different people. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that works well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.
  
  The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use Moran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of established patterns. Moran's I refines previously proposed stress measures. Furthermore, the popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a similar measure which further supports the use of Moran's I in this context. An ordering that maximizes Moran's I can be computed via solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP); approximate orderings can be computed more efficiently, using any of the approximation algorithms for metric TSP.
  
  We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection. Specifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation consistently outperforms other implementations. Our collection-aware implementations carry no significant additional computational costs.",,,Best Papers,best,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1346.html

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.",,,Best Papers,best,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1187.html

Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization,"Wesley Willett, Bon Adriel Aseniero, Sheelagh Carpendale, Pierre Dragicevic, Yvonne Jansen, Lora Oehlberg, Petra Isenberg","We explore how the lens of fictional superpowers can help characterize how visualizations empower people and provide inspiration for new visualization systems. Researchers and practitioners often tout visualizations’ ability to “make the invisible visible”and to “enhance cognitive abilities.” Meanwhile superhero comics and other modern fiction often depict characters with similarly fantastic abilities that allow them to see and interpret the world in ways that transcend traditional human perception. We investigate the intersection of these domains, and show how the language of superpowers can be used to characterize existing visualization systems and suggest opportunities for new and empowering ones. We introduce two frameworks: The first characterizes seven underlying mechanics that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed in fiction. The second identifies seven ways in which visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these observations, we illustrate a diverse set of “visualization superpowers” and highlight opportunities for the visualization community to create new system sand interactions that empower new experiences with data",,,Best Papers,best,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1160.html
51,Feature Curves and Surfaces of 3D Asymmetric Tensor Fields,"Shih-Hsuan Hung, Yue Zhang, Harry Yeh, Eugene Zhang","3D asymmetric tensor fields have found many applications in science and engineering domains, such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. 3D asymmetric tensors can have complex eigenvalues, which makes their analysis and visualization more challenging than 3D symmetric tensors. Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.",,,Best Papers,best,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1426.html

Yet, this pattern extraction does not occur in a single glance. Instead, research on visual attention suggests that the visual system iteratively applies a sequence of filtering operations on an image, extracting patterns from subsets of visual information over time, and selectively inhibiting other information at each of these moments. To demonstrate that this powerful series of filtering operations also occurs during the perception of visualized data, we designed a task where participants made judgments from one class of marks on a scatterplot, presumably incentivizing them to relatively ignore other classes of marks. Participants consistently missed a conspicuous dinosaur in the ignored collection of marks (93% for a 1s presentation, and 61% for 2.5s), but not in a control condition where the judgment task was removed (25% for a 1s presentation, and 11% for 2.5s), suggesting that data visualizations are not ""seen"" in a single glance, and instead require an active process of exploration.","Charts, Diagrams, and Plots, Communication/Presentation, Storytelling, Perception & Cognition",,Best Papers,best,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1184.html
53,Task-Based Effectiveness of Interactive Contiguous Area Cartograms,"Ian Duncan, Shi Tingsheng, Simon Perrault, Michael Gastner","Cartograms are map-based data visualizations in which the area of each map region is proportional to an associated numeric data value (e.g., population or gross domestic product). A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as “easy to use” and “helpful.” Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen.","task analysis, economic indicators, data visualization, animation, switches, software, shape, cartogram, geovisualization, interactive data exploration, quantitative evaluation",,Interaction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9275378.html

Interactive systems provide direct manipulation to create coordination between views, but are restricted to limited types of predefined templates. By contrast, textual specification languages enable flexible coordination but expose technical burden. To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs. The grammar design is informed by a novel framework based on a systematic review of 176 coordinations from existing theories and applications, which describes coordination by demonstration, i.e., how coordination is performed by users. With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions. We evaluate Nebula by demonstrating its expressiveness with a gallery of diverse examples and analyzing its usability on cognitive dimensions.","Data visualization, Grammar, Visualization, Usability, Libraries, Data models, Natural languages, Coordination, Multiple coordinated views, Interactive visualization, Grammar of graphics",,Interaction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9417674.html
55,Rotate or Wrap? Interactive Visualisations of Cyclical Data on Cylindrical or Toroidal Topologies,"Kun-Ting Chen, Tim Dwyer, Benjamin Bach, Kim Marriott","In this paper, we report on a study of visual representations for cyclical data and the effect of interactively wrapping a bar chart ‘around its boundaries’. Compared to linear bar chart, polar (or radial) visualisations have the advantage that cyclical data can be presented continuously without mentally bridging the visual ‘cut’ across the left-and-right boundaries. To investigate this hypothesis and to assess the effect the cut has on analysis performance, this paper presents results from a crowdsourced, controlled experiment with 72 participants comparing new continuous panning technique to linear bar charts (interactive wrapping). Our results show that bar charts with interactive wrapping lead to less errors compared to standard bar charts or polar charts. Inspired by these results, we generalise the concept of interactive wrapping to other visualisations for cyclical or relational data. We describe a design space based on the concept of one-dimensional wrapping and two-dimensional wrapping, linked to two common 3D topologies; cylinder and torus that can be used to metaphorically explain one- and two-dimensional wrapping. This design space suggests that interactive wrapping is widely applicable to many different data types.",,,Interaction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1155.html
56,DIEL: Interactive Visualization Beyond the Here and Now,"Yifan Wu, Remco Chang, Joseph Hellerstein, Arvind Satyanarayan, Eugene Wu","Interactive visualization design and research have primarily focused on local data and synchronous events. However, for more complex use cases—e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources—developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. Like many declarative visualization languages, DIEL developers need only specify what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it; uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions or server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a user interface at any time, developers author declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and synthesizes necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL’s performance and expressivity through ex-ample interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and coordination of asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL’s usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.",,,Interaction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1275.html
57,VizSnippets: Compressing Visualization Bundles Into Representative Previews for Browsing Visualization Collections,"Michael Oppermann, Tamara Munzner","Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or Power BI, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles. Result snippets, compact previews of these bundles, are presented to users to help them identify relevant content when browsing collections. Our engagement with Tableau product teams and review of existing snippet designs on five platforms showed us that current practices fail to help people judge the relevance of bundles because they include only the title and one image. Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen keywords.

58,Interactive Dimensionality Reduction for Comparative Analysis,"Takanori Fujiwara, Xinhai Wei, Jian Zhao, Kwan-Liu Ma","Finding the similarities and differences between two or more groups of datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. In this work, we introduce an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, we provide an interactive visualization interface to examine ULCA results with a rich set of analysis libraries. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework.",,,Interaction,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1570.html

60,Human-in-the-loop Extraction of Interpretable Concepts in Deep Learning Models,"Zhenge Zhao, Panpan Xu, Carlos Scheidegger, Liu Ren","The interpretation of deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a key topic as more people apply them to solve various problems and making critical decisions. Recently, concept-based explanation has become a popular approach for post-hoc interpretation of DNNs. Instead of focusing on a single data sample to obtain local interpretation such as saliency maps, concept-based explanation provides a global interpretation of model predictions by analyzing how visual concepts affects model decision. For example, how the presence of shadow affects an object detection model. However, identifying human-friendly visual concepts that affect model decisions is a challenging task that can not be easily addressed with automatic approaches. In this paper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop visual analytics framework to generate user-defined concepts for model interpretation and diagnostics. The core of our approach is the use of active learning, where we integrate human knowledge and feedback to train a concept extractor in each stage. We crop or segment the original images into small image patches, extract the latent presentations from the hidden layer of the task model, select image patches sharing a common concept, and train a shallow net on top of the latent representation to collect image patches containing the visual concept. We combine these processes into an interactive system, ConceptExtract. Through two case studies, we show how our approach helps analyze model behavior and extract human-friendly concepts for different machine learning tasks and datasets and how to use these concepts to understand the predictions, compare model performance and make suggestions for model refinement. Quantitative experiments show that our active learning approach can accurately extract meaningful visual concepts. More importantly, by identifying visual concepts that negatively affect model performance, we develop the corresponding data augmentation strategy that consistently improves model performance.",,,Explainable AI and Machine Learning,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1621.html
61,Towards Visual Explainable Active Learning for Zero-Shot Classification,"Shichao Jia, zeyu li, Nuo Chen, Jiawan Zhang","Zero-shot classification is a promising paradigm to solve an applicable problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance.

  multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
  However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes.
  It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions.
  Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences),
  and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models.
  In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. 
  Moreover, M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities.

We present NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. NeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs’ relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system’s tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The NeuroCartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.",,,Explainable AI and Machine Learning,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1194.html

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs.

65,Context Matters: A Theory of Semantic Discriminability for Perceptual Encoding Systems,"Kushin Mukherjee, Brian Yin, Brianne Sherman, Laurent Lessard, Karen Schloss","People’s associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in Semantic Discriminability Theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic Discriminability Theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory, and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously deemed “non-colorable” (Experiment 2).

66,Conceptual Metaphor and Graphical Convention Influence the Interpretation of Line Graphs,"Greg Woodin, Bodo Winter, Lace Padilla","Many metaphors in language reflect conceptual metaphors that structure thought. In line with metaphorical expressions such as ‘high number’, experiments show that people associate larger numbers with upward space. Consistent with this metaphor, high numbers are conventionally depicted in high positions on the y-axis of line graphs. People also associate good and bad (emotional valence) with upward and downward locations, in line with metaphorical expressions such as ‘uplifting’ and ‘down in the dumps’. Graphs depicting good quantities (e.g., vacation days) are consistent with graphical convention and the valence metaphor, because ‘more’ of the good quantity is represented by higher y-axis positions. In contrast, graphs depicting bad quantities (e.g., murders) are consistent with graphical convention, but not the valence metaphor, because more of the bad quantity is represented by higher (rather than lower) y-axis positions. We conducted two experiments (N = 300 per experiment) where participants answered questions about line graphs depicting good and bad quantities. For some graphs, we inverted the conventional axis ordering of numbers. Line graphs that aligned (vs misaligned) with valence metaphors (up = good) were easier to interpret, but this beneficial effect did not outweigh the adverse effect of inverting the axis numbering. Line graphs depicting good (vs bad) quantities were easier to interpret, as were graphs that depicted quantity using the x-axis (vs y-axis). Our results suggest that conceptual metaphors matter for the interpretation of line graphs. However, designers of line graphs are warned against subverting graphical convention to align with conceptual metaphors.","Conceptual Metaphor Theory, More is Up, Mental Number Line, Cognition, Linguistics, Emotional Valence, Line Graph, Axis Reversal, Handedness, Empirical Evaluation",,Graphical Perception and Coloring,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9451590.html
67,Rethinking the Ranks of Visual Channels,"Caitlyn McColeman, Fumeng Yang, Timothy F. Brady, Steven Franconeri","Data can be visually represented using visual channels like position, length or luminance. An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or ‘wind map’ (angle). 
  With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). 
  Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory.
  These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).",,,Graphical Perception and Coloring,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1398.html
68,Affective Congruence in Visualization Design: Influences on Reading Categorical Maps,"Cary Anderson, Anthony Robinson","Recent work in data visualization has demonstrated that small, perceptually-distinct color palettes—such as those used in categorical mapping—can connote significant affective qualities. Data that are mapped or otherwise visualized are also often emotive in nature, either inherently (e.g., climate change, disease mortality rates), or by design, such as can be found in visual storytelling. However, little is known about how the affective qualities of color interact with those of data context in visualization design. This paper describes the results of a crowdsourced study on the influence of affectively congruent versus incongruent color schemes on categorical map-reading response. We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design.",.,,Graphical Perception and Coloring,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9318559.html
69,Modeling Just Noticeable Differences in Charts,"Min Lu, Joel Lanir, Chufeng Wang, Yucong Yao, Wen Zhang, Oliver Deussen, Hui Huang","One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.",,,Graphical Perception and Coloring,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1633.html
70,Augmenting Parallel Coordinates Plots with Color-coded Stacked Histograms,"Jinwook Bok, Bohyoung Kim, Jinwook Seo","We introduce Parallel Histogram Plot (PHP), a technique that overcomes the innate limitations of parallel coordinates plot (PCP) by attaching stacked-bar histograms with discrete color schemes to PCP. The color-coded histograms enable users to see an overview of the whole data without cluttering or scalability issues. Each rectangle in the PHP histograms is color coded according to the data ranking by a selected attribute. This color-coding scheme allows users to visually examine relationships between attributes, even between those that are displayed far apart, without repositioning or reordering axes. We adopt the Visual Information Seeking Mantra so that the polylines of the original PCP can be used to show details of a small number of selected items when the cluttering problem subsides. We also design interactions, such as a focus+context technique, to help users investigate small regions of interest in a space-efficient manner. We provide a real-world example in which PHP is effectively utilized compared with other visualizations, and we perform a controlled user study to evaluate the performance of PHP in helping users estimate the correlation between attributes. The results demonstrate that the performance of PHP was consistent in the estimation of correlations between two attributes regardless of the distance between them.","Parallel Coordinates Plots, Parallel Histogram Plots, Color-coded Stacked Histogram",,Graphical Perception and Coloring,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9262081.html
71,Real-Time Denoising of Volumetric Path Tracing for Direct Volume Rendering,"Jose Iglesias-Guitian, Prajita Mane, Bochang Moon","Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) using Volumetric Path Tracing (VPT) is a scientific visualization technique that simulates light transport with objects' matter using physically-based lighting models. Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy, failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to the volume transfer function.","Volume rendering, global illumination, path-tracing, participating media, image-space filtering, real-time denoising.",,Surfaces and Volumes,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9258424.html
72,Learning Adaptive Sampling and Reconstruction for Volume Visualization,"Sebastian Weiss, Mustafa Isik, Justus Thies, Rüdiger Westermann","A central challenge in data visualization is to understand which data samples are required to generate an image of a data set in which the relevant information is encoded. In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering.","Volume visualization, adaptive sampling, deep learning",,Surfaces and Volumes,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9264699.html
73,STNet: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Synthesizing Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Volumes,"Jun Han, Hao Zheng, Danny Chen, Chaoli Wang","We present STNet, an end-to-end generative framework that synthesizes spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes with high fidelity for time-varying data. STNet includes two modules: a generator and a spatiotemporal discriminator. The input to the generator is two low-resolution volumes at both ends, and the output is the intermediate and the two-ending spatiotemporal super- resolution volumes. The spatiotemporal discriminator, leveraging convolutional long short-term memory, accepts a spatiotemporal super-resolution sequence as input and predicts a conditional score for each volume based on its spatial (the volume itself) and temporal (the previous volumes) information. We propose an unsupervised pre-training stage using cycle loss to improve the generalization of STNet. Once trained, STNet can generate spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes from low-resolution ones, offering scientists an option to save data storage (i.e., sparsely sampling the simulation output in both spatial and temporal dimensions). We compare STNet with the baseline bicubic+linear interpolation, two deep learning solutions (SSR+TSR, STD), and a state-of-the-art tensor compression solution (TTHRESH) to show the effectiveness of STNet.",,,Surfaces and Volumes,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1098.html
74,Interactive Exploration of Physically-Observable Objective Vortices in Unsteady 2D Flow,"Xingdi Zhang, Markus Hadwiger, Thomas Theussl, Peter Rautek","State-of-the-art computation and visualization of vortices in unsteady fluid flow employ objective vortex criteria, which makes them independent of reference frames or observers. However, objectivity by itself, although crucial, is not sufficient to guarantee that one can identify physically-realizable observers that would perceive or detect the same vortices. Moreover, a significant challenge is that a single reference frame is often not sufficient to accurately observe multiple vortices that follow different motions. This paper presents a novel framework for the exploration and use of an interactively-chosen set of observers, of the resulting relative velocity fields, and of objective vortex structures. We show that our approach facilitates the objective detection and visualization of vortices relative to well-adapted reference frame motions, while at the same time guaranteeing that these observers are in fact physically realizable. In order to represent and manipulate observers efficiently, we make use of the low-dimensional vector space structure of the Lie algebra of physically-realizable observer motions. We illustrate that our framework facilitates the efficient choice and guided exploration of objective vortices in unsteady 2D flow, on planar as well as on spherical domains, using well-adapted reference frames.",,,Surfaces and Volumes,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1582.html

Currently, non-invasive screening of patients is performed through visual inspection of 2D axis-aligned CT images, though the relevant features are often not clearly visible nor automatically detected. VP is an end-to-end visual diagnosis system that includes: a machine learning based automatic segmentation of the pancreatic gland and the lesions, a semi-automatic approach to extract the primary pancreatic duct, a machine learning based automatic classification of lesions into four prominent types, and specialized 3D and 2D exploratory visualizations of the pancreas, lesions and surrounding anatomy. We combine volume rendering with pancreas- and lesion-centric visualizations and measurements for effective diagnosis. We designed VP through close collaboration and feedback from expert radiologists, and evaluated it on multiple real-world CT datasets with various pancreatic lesions and case studies examined by the expert radiologists.","Visual diagnosis, Pancreatic cancer, Automatic segmentation, Lesion classification, Planar reformation, Pancreas, Three-dimensional displays, Ducts, Visualization, Computed tomography, Two dimensional displays",,Surfaces and Volumes,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9184129.html

Supported by a parallel coordinate plot, a multi-parameter brush is applied to all ensemble members to select data points with similar multi-parameter distribution. By a combination of spatial sub-division and a covariance analysis of partitioned sub-sets of data points, a tight partition in multi-parameter space with reduced number of selected data points is obtained. To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting. In two real-world application cases we show how our approach is used to analyse the multi-parameter distributions across an ensemble of 3D fields.","Ensemble visualization, multi-parameter visualization, 3D rendering, distribution comparison, parallel coordinate",,Surfaces and Volumes,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9362264.html

And exactly which part of town is the ‘city center'? While location is at the heart of many data questions, geographic location can be difficult to specify in natural language (NL) queries. This is especially true when working with fuzzy cognitive regions or regions that may be defined based on data distributions instead of absolute administrative location (e.g., state, country). GeoSneakPique presents a novel method for using a mapping widget to support the NL query process, allowing users to specify location via direct manipulation with data-driven guidance on spatial distributions to help select the area of interest. Users receive feedback to help them evaluate and refine their spatial selection interactively and can save spatial definitions for re-use in subsequent queries. We conduct a qualitative evaluation of the GeoSneakPique that indicates the usefulness of the interface as well as opportunities for better supporting geospatial workflows in visual analysis tasks employing cognitive regions.","Software Prototype, Geospatial Data",,"Social Sciences, Software Tools, Journalism, and Storytelling",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1047.html

The input and output of each rule is clearly defined, allowing inspection of visualization states throughout the generative process. We demonstrate Atlas’ expressiveness through a catalog of more than 40 visualization designs, and its extensibility through a case study of area-based visualizations.","Software Architecture, Toolkit/Library, Language, Software Prototype, Tabular Data",,"Social Sciences, Software Tools, Journalism, and Storytelling",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1064.html

This free-form medium has a long history and has been used as means for personal or intimate expression, as a way for marginalized people to describe issues that are important to them, and as a venue for graphical experimentation. It would seem then that zines would make an ideal vehicle for the recent interest in applying feminist or humanist ideas to visualization. Yet, there has been little work combining visualization and zines. In this paper we explore the potential of this intersection by analyzing examples of zines that use data graphics and by describing the pedagogical value that they can have in a visualization classroom. In doing so, we argue that there are plentiful opportunities for visualization research and practice in this rich intersectional-medium.","Social Science, Education, Humanities, Journalism, Intelligence Analysis, Knowledge Work, Communication/Presentation, Storytelling, General Public",,"Social Sciences, Software Tools, Journalism, and Storytelling",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1034.html

Professional and academic educational offerings typically focus on the computational skills required, but professionals in the field employ many non-technical methods. Sketching by hand on paper is a common practice. This paper introduces and classifes a corpus of 101 data sketches produced by participants as part of a guided learning activity in informal and formal settings. We manually coded each sketch against 12 metrics related to visual encodings, representations, and story structure. We find evidence for preferential use of positional and shape-based encodings, a wide variety of mixed symbolic and textual representations, and a high prevalence of stories comparing subsets of data. These findings contribute to our understanding of how learners sketch with data.

The Gemini² recommendation engine leverages Gemini, our prior work, and GraphScape to itemize the given complex change into semantic edit operations and to recombine operations into stages with a guided order for clearly conveying the semantics. To evaluate Gemini²’s recommendations, we conducted a human-subject study in which participants ranked recommended animations from both Gemini² and Gemini. We find that Gemini²’s animation recommendation ranking is well aligned with subjects’ preferences, and Gemini² can recommend favorable animations that Gemini cannot support.","Animation and Motion-related Techniques, Algorithms, Guidelines, Software Architecture, Toolkit/Library, Language, Software Prototype, Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies",,"Social Sciences, Software Tools, Journalism, and Storytelling",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1033.html

These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews.

Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis methods to help understand effective speaking strategies. In this paper, we propose E-ffective, a visual analytic system allowing speaking experts and novices to analyze both the role of speech factors and their contribution in effective speeches. From interviews with domain experts and investigating existing literature, we figured out important factors to consider in inspirational speeches. We obtained the generated factors from multi-modal data that were then related to effectiveness data. Our system supports rapid understanding of critical factors in inspirational speeches, including the influence of emotions by means of novel visualization methods and interaction. Two novel visualizations include E-spiral (that shows the emotional shifts in speeches in a visually compact way) and E-script (that connects speech content with key speech delivery information).

It includes redress and complaints on decisions of a child’s education, social care, licensing, planning, environment, housing and homelessness. However, if someone has a complaint or an issue, it is challenging for people to understand different possible redress paths and explore what path is suitable for their situation. Explanatory visualisation has the potential to display these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see, understand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further complicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance and policies and requires judicial interpretation. Consequently, there is not a single database of paths of redress. In this work we present how we have co-designed a system to visualise administrative justice paths of redress. Simultaneously, we classify, collate and organise the underpinning data, from expert workshops, heuristic evaluation and expert critical reflection. We make four contributions: (i) an application design study of the explanatory visualisation tool (Artemus), (ii) coordinated and co-design approach to aggregating the data, (iii) two in-depth case studies in housing and education demonstrating explanatory paths of redress in administrative law, and (iv) reflections on the expert co-design process and expert data gathering and explanatory visualisation for administrative justice and law.",,,Perspectives and Reflections,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1316.html

Decision makers rely on data analysis, which is either delegated to analysts, or done on their own. Often the decision maker combines data, likely uncertain or incomplete, with non-formalized knowledge within a multi-objective problem space, weighing the recommendations of analysts within broader contexts and goals. As most past research in visual analytics has focused on understanding the needs and challenges of data analysts, less is known about the tasks and challenges of organizational decision makers, and how visualization support tools might help. Here we characterize the decision maker as a domain expert, review relevant literature in management theories, and report the results of an empirical survey and interviews with people who make organizational decisions. We identify challenges and opportunities for novel visualization tools, including trade-off overviews, scenario-based analysis, interrogation tools, flexible data input and collaboration support.

Its centerpiece is an ontology that is able to automatically analyze and classify input data, linked to a database to store classified instances.

We conduct a critical investigation on whether the activity of decision making is indeed central to the visualization domain. By approaching decision making as a user task, we explore the degree to which decision tasks are evident in visualization research and user studies. Our analysis suggests that decision tasks are not commonly found in current visualization task taxonomies and that the visualization field has yet to leverage guidance from decision theory domains on how to study such tasks. We further found that the majority of visualizations addressing decision making were not evaluated based on their ability to assist decision tasks. Finally, to help expand the impact of visual analytics in organizational as well as casual decision making activities, we initiate a research agenda on how decision making assistance could be elevated throughout visualization research.",,,Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1341.html
95,From Jam Session to Recital: Synchronous Communication and Collaboration Around Data in Organization,"Matthew Brehmer, Robert Kosara","Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience’s view, and the coordination of a presenter’s video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees’ responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences.",,,Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1065.html
96,Causal Support: Modeling Causal Inferences with Visualizations,"Alex Kale, Yifan Wu, Jessica Hullman","Analysts often make visual causal inferences about possible data-generating models. However, visual analytics (VA) software tends to leave these models implicit in the mind of the analyst, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of informal visual ""insights"". We formally evaluate the quality of causal inferences from visualizations by adopting causal support---a Bayesian cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations given some data---as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users’ causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.",,,Decision Making,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1417.html
97,Sibyl: Understanding and Addressing the Usability Challenges of Machine Learning In High-Stakes Decision Making,"Alexandra Zytek, Dongyu Liu, Rhema Vaithianathan, Kalyan Veeramachaneni","Machine learning (ML) is being applied to a diverse and ever-growing set of domains. In many cases, domain experts --- who often have no expertise in ML or data science --- are asked to use ML predictions to make high-stakes decisions. Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we designed, implemented, and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback is collected, from which we also composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers that aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.",,,Decision Making,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1492.html
98,Semantic Snapping for Guided Multi-View Visualization Design,"Yngve S. Kristiansen, Laura Garrison, Stefan Bruckner","Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is ""aligned'' with the remaining views--not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.",,,Multi-View and Visual Environments,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1349.html
99,SightBi: Exploring Cross-View Data Relationships with Biclusters,"Maoyuan Sun, Abdul Rahman Shaikh, Hamed Alhoori, Jian Zhao","Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been heavily used in visual analysis tools for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking). They may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the usage of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalize cross-view data relationships as biclusters and compute them from a dataset. SightBi uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps to preserve existing views and serves as an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user explorations. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.",,,Multi-View and Visual Environments,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1293.html

Experts have attempted to replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes that have wider electrochemical window and higher stability due to the potential safety risks, such as electrolyte leakage, flammable solvents, poor thermal stability, and many side reactions caused by liquid electrolytes. However, finding suitable alternative materials using traditional approaches is very difficult due to the incredibly high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML)-based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. However, learning tools designed for domain experts to conduct intuitive performance comparison and analysis of ML models are rare. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models and understand and explore the predication results comprehensively. Our system uses a multifaceted visualization scheme designed to support analysis from various perspectives, such as feature distribution, data similarity, model performance, and result presentation. Case studies with actual lab experiments have been conducted by the experts, and the final results confirmed the effectiveness and helpfulness of our system.",,,Multi-View and Visual Environments,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1462.html

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results.","Visual analytics, feature extraction, visual query, multi-dimensional, time-dependent visualization, astrophysics, blazar",,Multi-View and Visual Environments,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9200781.html
102,Towards replacing physical testing of granular materials with a Topology-based Model,"Aniketh Venkat, Attila Gyulassy, Graham Kosiba, Amitesh Maiti, Henry Reinstein, Richard Gee, Peer-Timo Bremer, Valerio Pascucci","In the study of packed granular materials, the performance of a sample (e.g., the detonation of a high-energy explosive) often correlates to measurements of a fluid flowing through it. The “effective surface area,” the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model (PNM) based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.",,,Multi-View and Visual Environments,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1681.html
103,Tracking Internal Frames of Reference for Consistent Molecular Distribution Functions,"Robin Skånberg, Martin Falk, Mathieu Linares, Anders Ynnerman, Ingrid Hotz","In molecular analysis, Spatial Distribution Functions (SDF) are fundamental instruments in answering questions related to spatial occurrences and relations of atomic structures over time. Given a molecular trajectory, SDFs can, for example, reveal the occurrence of water in relation to particular structures and hence provide clues of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. For the computation of meaningful distribution functions, the definition of molecular reference structures is essential. Therefore we introduce the concept of an internal frame of reference (IFR) for labeled point sets that represent selected molecular structures, and we propose an algorithm for tracking the IFR over time and space using a variant of Kabsch’s algorithm. This approach lets us generate a consistent space for the aggregation of the SDF for molecular trajectories and molecular ensembles. We demonstrate the usefulness of the technique by applying it to temporal molecular trajectories as well as ensemble datasets. The examples include different docking scenarios with DNA, insulin, and aspirin.","Molecule Visualization, Molecular Dynamics, Interactive Exploration",,Multi-View and Visual Environments,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9324971.html

Rule sets are typically presented as a text-based list of logical statements (rules). Surprisingly, to date there has been limited work on exploring visual alternatives for presenting rules. In this paper, we explore the idea of designing alternative representations of rules, focusing on a number of visual factors we believe have a positive impact on rule readability and understanding. We then presents a user study exploring their impact. The results show that some design factors have a strong impact on how efficiently readers can process the rules while having minimal impact on accuracy. This work can help practitioners employ more effective solutions when using rules as a communication strategy to understand ML models.","Machine Learning, Statistics, Modelling, and Simulation Applications, Visual Representation Design, Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies, Tabular Data",,AI+VIS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1016.html

Our research team previously developed a new structured process for such users to assess AI, called After-Action Review for AI (AAR/AI), consisting of a series of steps a human takes to assess an AI agent and formalize their understanding. In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levels--episode-level, decision-level, and explanation-level--and integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine. We believe integrating structured processes like AAR/AI into visualization tools can help visualization play a more critical role in AI interpretability.","Machine Learning, Statistics, Modelling, and Simulation Applications, Data Analysis, Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Decision Making, Process/Workflow Design",,AI+VIS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1065.html

Recently, expressive nonlinear models are employed to support these tasks.
However, the interpretation of these human-steered nonlinear models during human-in-the-loop analysis has not been explored.
To address this problem, we present a new visual explanation design called semantic explanation. 
Semantic explanation visualizes model behaviors in a manner that is similar to users' direct projection manipulations.
This design conforms to the spatial analytic process and enables analysts better understand the updated model in response to their interactions.
We propose a pipeline to empower interactive dimensionality reduction with semantic explanation using counterfactuals. 
Based on the pipeline, we implement a visual text analytics system with nonlinear dimensionality reduction powered by deep learning via the BERT model.

Meanwhile, the increased integration of these models into various application domains has further highlighted the need for greater interpretability and transparency. To identify problems such as bias, overfitting, and incorrect correlations, data scientists require tools that explain the mechanisms with which these model decisions are made. In this paper we introduce AdViCE, a visual analytics tool that aims to guide users in black-box model debugging and validation. The solution rests on two main visual user interface innovations: (1) an interactive visualization design that enables the comparison of decisions on user-defined data subsets; (2) an algorithm and visual design to compute and visualize counterfactual explanations - explanations that depict model outcomes when data features are perturbed from their original values. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the work through a number of use cases that demonstrate the capabilities and potential limitations of the proposed approach.","Domain Agnostic, Charts, Diagrams, and Plots, Coordinated and Multiple Views, Other Topics and Techniques, Data Analysis, Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Decision Making, Algorithms, Interaction Design, Process/Workflow Design, Visual Representation Design, Tabular Data",,AI+VIS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1178.html

However, detecting covariate shift is challenging, especially when the data is high-dimensional images, and when multiple types of localized covariate shift affect different subspaces of the data. Although automated techniques can be used to detect the existence of covariate shift, our goal is to help human users characterize the extent of covariate shift in large image datasets with visual interfaces that seamlessly integrate information obtained from the detection algorithms. In this paper, we design and evaluate a new visual analytics approach that facilitates the comparison of the local distributions of training and test data. We conduct a quantitative user study on multi-attribute facial data to compare two different learned low-dimensional latent representations (pretrained ImageNet CNN vs. density ratio) and two user analytic workflows (nearest-neighbor vs. cluster-to-cluster). Our results indicate that the latent representation of our density ratio model, combined with a nearest-neighbor comparison, is the most effective at helping humans identify covariate shift.","Machine Learning Techniques, Machine Learning, Statistics, Modelling, and Simulation Applications, Comparison and Similarity, Image and Video Data",,AI+VIS,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1050.html

To address this contradiction, I argue that the practice of physicalization forces us to rethink traditional notions of data. This article proposes a conceptual framework to examine how physicalizations relate to data. This article develops a two-dimensional conceptual space for comparing different perspectives on data used in physicalization, drawing from design theory and critical data studies literature. One axis distinguishes between epistemological and ontological perspectives, focusing on the relationship between data and the mind. The second axis distinguishes how data relate to the world, differentiating between representational and relational perspectives. To clarify the aesthetic and conceptual implications of these different perspectives, the article discusses examples of data physicalization for each quadrant of the continuous space. It further uses the framework to examine the explicit and implicit assumptions about data in physicalization literature. As a theoretical article, it encourages practitioners to think about how data relate to the manifestations and the phenomena they try to capture.

State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs. We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton(S-PDFA) – a model that accentuates infrequent severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from the S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses several thousands of alerts into only a handful of AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and enable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.",,,Machine Learning and Privacy,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vizsec-2863.html

123,InfoColorizer: Interactive Recommendation of Color Palettes for Infographics,"Lin-Ping Yuan, Ziqi Zhou, Jian Zhao, Yiqiu Guo, Fan Du, Huamin Qu","When designing infographics, general users usually struggle with getting desired color palettes using existing infographic authoring tools, which sometimes sacrifice customizability, require design expertise, or neglect the influence of elements’ spatial arrangement. We propose a data-driven method that provides flexibility by considering users’ preferences, lowers the expertise barrier via automation, and tailors suggested palettes to the spatial layout of elements. We build a recommendation engine by utilizing deep learning techniques to characterize good color design practices from data, and further develop InfoColorizer, a tool that allows users to obtain color palettes for their infographics in an interactive and dynamic manner. To validate our method, we conducted a comprehensive four-part evaluation, including case studies, a controlled user study, a survey study, and an interview study. The results indicate that InfoColorizer can provide compelling palette recommendations with adequate flexibility, allowing users to effectively obtain high-quality color design for input infographics with low effort.","Color palettes design, infographics, visualization recommendation, machine learning.",,Recommendation and Automation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9444798.html
124,A Mixed-Initiative Approach to Reusing Infographic Charts,"Weiwei Cui, Jinpeng Wang, He Huang, Yun Wang, Chin-Yew Lin, Haidong Zhang, Dongmei Zhang","Infographic bar charts have been widely adopted for communicating numerical information because of their attractiveness and memorability. However, these infographics are often created manually with general tools, such as PowerPoint and Adobe Illustrator, and merely composed of primitive visual elements, such as text blocks and shapes. With the absence of chart models, updating or reusing these infographics requires tedious and error-prone manual edits. In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative approach to mitigate this pain point. On one hand, machines are adopted to perform precise and trivial operations, such as mapping numerical values to shape attributes and aligning shapes. On the other hand, we rely on humans to perform subjective and creative tasks, such as changing embellishments or approving the edits made by machines. We encapsulate our technique in a PowerPoint add-in prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness by applying our technique on a diverse set of infographic bar chart examples.",,,Recommendation and Automation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1637.html
125,Kori: Interactive Synthesis of Text and Charts in Data Documents,"Shahid Latif, Zheng Zhou, Yoon Kim, Fabian Beck, Nam Wook Kim","Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of such references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.",,,Recommendation and Automation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1008.html
126,Deconstructing Categorization in Visualization Recommendation: A Taxonomy and Comparative Study,"Doris Lee, Vidya Setlur, Melanie Tory, Karrie Karahalios, Aditya Parameswaran","Visualization recommendation (VisRec) systems provide users with suggestions for potentially interesting and useful next steps during exploratory data analysis. These recommendations are typically organized into categories based on their analytical actions, i.e., operations employed to transition from the current exploration state to a recommended visualization. However, despite the emergence of a plethora of VisRec systems in recent work, the utility of the categories employed by these systems in analytical workflows has not been systematically investigated. Our paper explores the efficacy of recommendation categories by formalizing a taxonomy of common categories and developing a system, Frontier, that implements these categories. Using Frontier, we evaluate workflow strategies adopted by users and how categories influence those strategies. Participants found recommendations that add attributes to enhance the current visualization and recommendations that filter to sub-populations to be comparatively most useful during data exploration. Our findings pave the way for next-generation VisRec systems that are adaptive and personalized via carefully chosen, effective recommendation categories.","visual analysis, analytical workflow, discovery-driven analysis, visualization recommendations",,Recommendation and Automation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9444894.html
127,KG4Vis: A Knowledge Graph-Based Approach for Visualization Recommendation,"Haotian Li, Yong Wang, Songheng Zhang, Yangqiu Song, Huamin Qu","Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective data visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data visualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",,,Recommendation and Automation,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1103.html

Therefore, additional specification adjustments are still required in real-world use cases. However, manual adjustments are difficult since most users do not necessarily possess adequate skills or visualization knowledge. Even experienced users might create imperfect visualizations that involve chart construction errors. We present a framework, VizFixer, to help users detect flaws and rectify already-built but defective visualizations. The framework consists of two components, (1) a visualization linter, which applies well-recognized principles to inspect the legitimacy of rendered visualizations, and (2) a visualization fixer, which automatically corrects the detected violations according to the linter. We implement the framework into an online editor prototype based on Vega-Lite specifications. To further evaluate the system, we conduct an in-lab user study.

In this paper, we present a technical solution to address this challenge. Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-design user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment.

This field, however, has predominantly focused on the data collection and insight-generation elements of self-tracking, with less attention paid to flexible data analysis. As a result, this inattention has lead to inflexible analytic pipelines that do not reflect or support the diverse ways people want to engage their data. This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people with engaging and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, which we call the personal informatics analysis gap. We explore this gap through a multi-stage longitudinal study on how asthmatics engage personal air quality data, and we report how participants: are motivated by broad and diverse goals; exhibited patterns in the way they explored their data; engaged with their data in playful ways; discovered new insights through serendipitous exploration; and were reluctant to use analysis tools on their own. These results present new opportunities for visual analysis research and suggest the need for fundamental shifts in how and what we design for supporting analysis of personal data.",,,"Immersive Environments, Personal Vis, and Dashboards",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1022.html

A Survey and Perspectives on Situatedness,"Nathalie Bressa, Henrik Korsgaard, Aurélien Tabard, Steven Houben, Jo Vermeulen","Situated visualization is an emerging concept within information visualization, in which data is visualized in situ, where it is relevant to people. The concept has gained interest from multiple research communities, including information visualization, human-computer interaction and augmented reality. This has led to a range of explorations and applications of the concept, however, this early work has focused on the operational aspect of situatedness leading to inconsistent adoption of the concept and terminology. 
  First, we contribute a literature survey in which we analyze 40 papers that explicitly use the term ""situated visualization"" to provide an overview of the research area, how it defines situated visualization, common application areas and technology used, as well as type of data and type of visualizations. Our survey shows that research on situated visualization has focused on technology-centric approaches that forefront a spatial understanding of situatedness. 
  Secondly, we contribute five perspectives on situatedness (space, time, place, activity, and community) that expand on the prevalent notion of situatedness in the corpus. We draw from six case studies and prior theoretical developments in HCI. Each perspective develops a generative way of looking at and working with situatedness in design and research. We outline future directions, including considering technology, material and aesthetics, leveraging the perspectives for design, and methods for stronger engagement with target audiences. We conclude with opportunities to consolidate situated visualization research.",,,"Immersive Environments, Personal Vis, and Dashboards",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1106.html

The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result.

134,An Automated Approach to Reasoning About Task-Oriented Insights in Responsive Visualization,"Hyeok Kim, Ryan Rossi, Abhraneel Sarma, Dominik Moritz, Jessica Hullman","Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation.",,,"Immersive Environments, Personal Vis, and Dashboards",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1219.html

We hypothesize that perceiving approximately monotonic trends across multiple attributes is key to the overall interpretability of sorted results, because users can easily predict the attribute values of the next items. We extend a ranking principal curve model to tune monotonic trends in attributes and present Imma Sort to sort items by multiple attributes simultaneously by trading-off the monotonicity in the primary sorted attribute to increase the human predictability for other attributes. We characterize how it performs for varying attribute correlations, attribute preferences, list lengths and number of attributes. We further extend Imma Sort with ImmaAnchor and ImmaCenter to improve the learnability and efficiency to search sorted items with conflicting attributes. We demonstrate usage scenarios for two applications and evaluate its learnability, usability, interpretability and user performance in prediction and search tasks. We find that Imma Sort improves the interpretability and satisfaction of sorting by ≥ 2 attributes. We discuss why, when, where, and how to deploy Imma Sort for real-world applications.","Multi-attribute sorting, decision making, interpretability, human predictability, predictive interpretability.",,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9288641.html

In this work, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated.","Dual Analysis approach, High-dimensional data, Mixed data, Mixed statistical analysis",,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9346003.html

However, different DR techniques would yield various patterns, which significantly affect the performance of visual cluster analysis tasks. We present the results of a user study that investigates the influence of different DR techniques on visual cluster analysis. Our study focuses on the most concerned property types, namely the linearity and locality, and evaluates twelve representative DR techniques that cover the concerned properties. Four controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate how the DR techniques facilitate the tasks of 1) identifying clusters, 2) associating cluster members, 3) comparing distances among clusters, and 4) comparing cluster densities, respectively. We also evaluated users’ subjective preference of the DR techniques regarding the quality of projected clusters. The results show that: 1) Non-linear and Local techniques are preferred in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 2) Linear techniques perform better than non-linear techniques in comparing cluster densities; 3) UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) perform the best in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 4) NMF(Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) has competitive performance in comparing distances among clusters; 5) t-SNLE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Linear Embedding) has competitive performance in comparing cluster densities.",,,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1532.html

This becomes increasingly difficult in high dimensional datasets. While dimensionality reduction techniques can be utilized to reduce the analysis space, these may unintentionally bury key dimensions within a larger grouping and obfuscate meaningful patterns. With this work we introduce DimLift, a novel visual analysis method for creating and interacting with dimensional bundles. Generated through an iterative dimensionality reduction or user-driven approach, dimensional bundles are expressive groups of dimensions that contribute similarly to the variance of a dataset. Interactive exploration and reconstruction methods via a layered parallel coordinates plot allow users to lift interesting and subtle relationships to the surface, even in complex scenarios of missing and mixed data types. We exemplify the power of this technique in an expert case study on clinical cohort data alongside two additional case examples from nutrition and ecology.","Dimensionality reduction, interactive visual analysis, visual analytics, parallel coordinates",,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9349198.html

Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.",,,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1440.html
140,Measuring and Explaining the Inter-Cluster Reliability of Multidimensional Projections,"Hyeon Jeon, Hyung-Kwon Ko, Jaemin Jo, Youngtaek Kim, Jinwook Seo","We propose Steadiness and Cohesiveness, two novel metrics to measure the inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.",,,Multi-Dimensional Data,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1020.html

We describe the use of ParaView, a well-established visualization application, to produce images and animations of results from a large set of modeling experiments, and their use in the promulgation of climate research results. Visualization can also make useful contributions to development, particularly for complex large-scale applications such as climate models.

Yet, they also easily overwhelm visitors due to their perceptual richness and associated information. Similarly, digitized collections appear as complex, multifaceted phenomena, which can be challenging to grasp and navigate. Though visualizations can create various types of collection overviews for that matter, they do not easily assemble into a “big picture” or lead to an integrated understanding. We introduce coherence techniques to maximize connections between multiple views and apply them to the prototype PolyCube system of collection visualization: with map, set, and network visualizations it makes spatial, categorical, and relational collection aspects visible. For the essential temporal dimension, it offers four different views: superimposition, animation, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representations.

State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs. We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton(S-PDFA) – a model that accentuates infrequent severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from the S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses several thousands of alerts into only a handful of AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and enable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.","Fortinet Ltd, Edinburgh",,"Threat Detection, Computer Forensics & Software Vulnerability Analysis ",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vizsec-9866.html

Currently, there is no reliable automated solution to support this decision-making. Therefore, we derive requirements for visually supporting the decision-making process for live forensic investigations and introduce a research prototype that provides visual guidance for cyber forensic experts during a live digital forensic investigation.

But often these reports are hard to understand, include false positives or overwhelm users due to the sheer number of alerts, since a report may contain hundreds to thousands of vulnerabilities. Developers must undergo a process called vulnerability triage to find the relevant vulnerabilities to fix. This paper presents two interactive visualizations for developers and security experts to gain an overview of the security state of their application. Users can see the distribution of vulnerabilities, find the most relevant ones, and compare differences between application versions. Our visualization design is inspired by an initial preliminary study and has been evaluated by domain experts to investigate the usability and appropriateness.","Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt",,"Threat Detection, Computer Forensics & Software Vulnerability Analysis ",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vizsec-4137.html

Dennig, Eren Cakmak, Henrik Plate, Daniel Keim","The prevalent usage of open-source software (OSS) has led to an increased interest in resolving potential third-party security risks by fixing common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). However, even with automated code analysis tools in place, security analysts often lack the means to obtain an overview of vulnerable OSS reuse in large software organizations. In this design study, we propose VulnEx (Vulnerability Explorer), a tool to audit entire software development organizations. We introduce three complementary table-based representations to identify and assess vulnerability exposures due to OSS, which we designed in collaboration with security analysts. The presented tool allows examining problematic projects and applications (repositories), third-party libraries, and vulnerabilities across a software organization. We show the applicability of our tool through a use case and preliminary expert feedback.",University of Konstanz,,"Threat Detection, Computer Forensics & Software Vulnerability Analysis ",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_a-vizsec-2128.html

However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level (what the constituents are) and clip-level (how those constituents are organized). We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities.",,,"Sports, Commerce, and Social Media",honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1578.html
156,TacticFlow: Visual Analytics of Ever-Changing Tactics in Racket Sports,"Jiang Wu, Dongyu Liu, Ziyang Guo, Qingyang Xu, Yingcai Wu","Event sequence mining is often used to summarize patterns from hundreds of sequences but faces special challenges when handling racket sports data. In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent’s reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively. Based on the mined results, we propose a glyph-based Sankey diagram to visualize the ever-changing tactic progression and support interactive data exploration. Through two case studies with four domain experts in tennis and badminton, we demonstrate that our system can effectively obtain insights about tactic progression in most racket sports. We further discuss the strengths and the limitations of our system based on domain experts’ feedback.",,,"Sports, Commerce, and Social Media",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1135.html
157,VideoModerator: A Risk-aware Framework for Multimodal Video Moderation in E-Commerce,"Tan Tang, Yanhong Wu, Lingyun Yu, Yuhong Li, Yingcai Wu","Video moderation, which refers to remove deviant or explicit content from e-commerce livestreams, has become prevalent owing to social and engaging features. However, this task is tedious and time consuming due to the difficulties associated with watching and reviewing multimodal video content, including video frames and audio clips. To ensure effective video moderation, we propose VideoModerator, a risk-aware framework that seamlessly integrates human knowledge with machine insights. This framework incorporates a set of advanced machine learning models to extract the risk-aware features from multimodal video content and discover potentially deviant videos. Moreover, this framework introduces an interactive visualization interface with three views, namely, a video view, a frame view, and an audio view. In the video view, we adopt a segmented timeline and highlight high-risk periods that may contain deviant information. In the frame view, we present a novel visual summarization method that combines risk-aware features and video context to enable quick video navigation. In the audio view, we employ a storyline-based design to provide a multi-faceted overview which can be used to explore audio content. Furthermore, we report the usage of VideoModerator through a case scenario and conduct experiments and a controlled user study to validate its effectiveness.",,,"Sports, Commerce, and Social Media",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1218.html
158,A Visualization Approach for Monitoring Order Processing in E-Commerce Warehouse,"Junxiu Tang, Yuhua Zhou, Tan Tang, Di Weng, Boyang Xie, Lingyun Yu, Huaqiang Zhang, Yingcai Wu","The efficiency of warehouses is vital to e-commerce. Fast order processing at the warehouses ensures timely deliveries and improves customer satisfaction. However, monitoring, analyzing, and manipulating order processing in the warehouses in real time are challenging for traditional methods due to the sheer volume of incoming orders, the fuzzy definition of delayed order patterns, and the complex decision-making of order handling priorities. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that attracts much attention but remains difficult to understand. Particularly important to the success, stability, and security of Bitcoin is a component of the system called ""mining.'' Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior. Each of these features can be compared to external data concerning pool characteristics and Bitcoin news. In order to assess the value of MiningVis, we conducted online interviews and insight-based user studies with Bitcoin miners.

The real-time analysis of posts on such platforms can reveal valuable and timely insights for journalists, politicians, business analysts, and first responders, but the high number and diversity of new posts pose a challenge. In this work, we present an interactive system that enables the visual analysis of streaming social media data on a large scale in real-time. We propose an efficient and explainable dynamic clustering algorithm that powers a continuously updated visualization of the current thematic landscape as well as detailed visual summaries of specific topics of interest. Our parallel clustering strategy provides an adaptive stream with a digestible but diverse selection of recent posts related to relevant topics. We also integrate familiar visual metaphors that are highly interlinked for enabling both explorative and more focused monitoring tasks. Analysts can gradually increase the resolution to dive deeper into particular topics. In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated posts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events.

161,CoUX: Collaborative Visual Analysis of Think-Aloud Usability Test Videos for Digital Interfaces,"Ehsan Jahangirzadeh Soure, Emily Kuang, Mingming Fan, Jian Zhao","Reviewing a think-aloud video is both time-consuming and demanding as it requires UX (user experience) professionals to attend to many behavioral signals of the user in the video. Moreover, challenges arise when multiple UX professionals need to collaborate to reduce bias and errors. We propose a collaborative visual analytics tool, CoUX, to facilitate UX evaluators collectively reviewing think-aloud usability test videos of digital interfaces. CoUX seamlessly supports usability problem identification, annotation, and discussion in an integrated environment. To ease the discovery of usability problems, CoUX visualizes a set of problem-indicators based on acoustic, textual, and visual features extracted from the video and audio of a think-aloud session with machine learning.CoUX further enables collaboration amongst UX evaluators for logging, commenting, and consolidating the discovered problems with a chatbox-like user interface. We designed CoUX based on a formative study with two UX experts and insights derived from the literature. We conducted a user study with six pairs of UX practitioners on collaborative think-aloud video analysis tasks. The results indicate that CoUX is useful and effective in facilitating both problem identification and collaborative teamwork. We provide insights into how different features of CoUX were used to support both independent analysis and collaboration.

162,Professional Differences: A Comparative Study of Visualization Task Performance and Spatial Ability Across Disciplines,"Kyle Hall, Anthony Kouroupis, Anastasia Bezerianos, Danielle Albers Szafir, Christopher Collins","Problem-driven visualization work is rooted in deeply understanding the data, actors, processes, and workflows of a target domain. However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions for specificity in visualization design: Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex visualizations (isocontour plots and scatterplots), but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific visualization with specific recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.",,,Studies and Evaluation Methodology,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1452.html

We find that there is little to no agreement in ordering of rainbow colors while sequential colors are indeed intuitively ordered by the participants with a strong dark is more bias. Sequential colors facilitate most quantitative map reading tasks better than the rainbow colors, whereas rainbow colors competitively facilitate extracting specific values from a map, and may support hue recall better than sequential. We thus contribute to dark- vs. light is more bias debate, and demonstrate why and when rainbow colors may impair performance, and add further nuance to our understanding of this highly popular, yet highly criticized color scheme.","Color, visualization, colormap, color perception, visual design",,Studies and Evaluation Methodology,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9249052.html
164,Understanding Data Visualization Design Practice,Paul Parsons,"Professional roles for data visualization designers are growing in popularity, and interest in relationships between the academic research and professional practice communities is gaining traction. However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These findings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.",,,Studies and Evaluation Methodology,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1683.html
165,"Learning Objectives, Insights, and Assessments: How Specification Formats Impact Design","Elsie Lee, Shiqing He, Eytan Adar","Despite the ubiquity of communicative visualizations, specifying communicative intent during design is ad hoc. Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.",,,Studies and Evaluation Methodology,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1334.html
166,Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables,"Lyn Bartram, Michael Correll, Melanie Tory","Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets — the quintessential table tool — remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and “get their hands on” the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.",,,Studies and Evaluation Methodology,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1224.html
167,Accessible Visualization via Natural Language Descriptions: A Four-Level Model of Semantic Content,"Alan Lundgard, Arvind Satyanarayan","Natural language descriptions sometimes accompany visualizations to better communicate and contextualize their insights, and to improve their accessibility for readers with disabilities. However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.",,,Accessible Visualization and Natural Language,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1401.html
168,Towards Understanding Sensory Substitution for Accessible Visualization: An Interview Study,"Pramod Chundury, Biswaksen Patnaik, Yasmin Reyazuddin, Christine Tang, Jonathan Lazar, Niklas Elmqvist","For all its potential in supporting data analysis, particularly in exploratory situations, visualization also creates barriers: accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals. Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&M experts—all of them blind—to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible—using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses—sound and touch—to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.",,,Accessible Visualization and Natural Language,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1145.html

Especially for graphics that contain rich information, such as visualizations, poorly written or an absence of alternative texts can worsen the information access inequality for people with visual impairments. In this work, we consolidate existing guidelines and survey current practices to inspect to what extent current practices and recommendations are aligned. Then, to gain more insight into what people want in visualization alternative texts, we interviewed 22 people with visual impairments regarding their experience with visualizations and their information needs in alternative texts. The study findings suggest that participants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head while listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks (e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would. The study also provides ample support for the need to reference the underlying data instead of visual elements to reduce users’ cognitive burden.

The state-of-the-art NL2VIS approaches (e.g., NL4DV and FlowSense) are based on semantic parsers and heuristic algorithms, which are not end-to-end and are not designed for supporting (possibly) complex data transformations. Deep neural network powered neural machine translation models have made great strides in many machine translation tasks, which suggests that they might be viable for NL2VIS as well. In this paper, we present ncNet, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for supporting NL2VIS, with several novel visualization-aware optimizations, including using attention-forcing to optimize the learning process, and visualization-aware rendering to produce better visualization result. To enhance the capability of machine to comprehend natural language queries, ncNet is also designed to take an optional chart template (e.g., a pie chart or a scatter plot) as input, where the chart template will be served as a constraint to limit what could be visualized.

Yet, researchers still lack systematic knowledge on how viewers verbalize their interpretations of visualizations, and how they interpret verbalizations of visualizations in such contexts. We describe two studies aimed at identifying characteristics of data and charts that are relevant in such tasks. The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of orrelations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language.","Information visualization, natural language generation, natural language processing, human-computer interaction",,Accessible Visualization and Natural Language,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9195155.html

The key of FTK is our simplicial spacetime meshing scheme that generalizes both regular and unstructured spatial meshes to spacetime while tessellating spacetime mesh elements into simplices. The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing. The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces. As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.

174,A Progressive Approach to Scalar Field Topology,"Jules Vidal, Pierre Guillou, Julien Tierny","This paper introduces progressive algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data. Our approach is based on a hierarchical representation of the input data and the fast identification of topologically invariant vertices, which are vertices that have no impact on the topological description of the data and for which we show that no computation is required as they are introduced in the hierarchy. This enables the definition of efficient coarse-to-fine topological algorithms, which leverage fast update mechanisms for ordinary vertices and avoid computation for the topologically invariant ones. We demonstrate our approach with two examples of topological algorithms (critical point extraction and persistence diagram computation), which generate interpretable outputs upon interruption requests and which progressively refine them otherwise. Experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our progressive strategy, in addition to the continuous visual feedback it provides, even improves run time performance with regard to non-progressive algorithms and we describe further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. We illustrate the utility of our approach in batch-mode and interactive setups, where it respectively enables the control of the execution time of complete topological pipelines as well as previews of the topological features found in a dataset, with progressive updates delivered within interactive times.","Topological data analysis, scalar data, progressive visualization.",,"Flow, Topology, and Fields",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9359504.html

However, none of these recent approaches computed complete merge trees on distributed systems, leaving this field to traditional divide and conquer approaches. This paper introduces a scalable, parallel and distributed algorithm for merge tree construction outperforming the previously fastest distributed solution by a factor of around three. This is achieved by a task-parallel identification of individual merge tree arcs by growing regions around critical points in the data, without any need for ordered progression or global data structures, based on a novel insight introducing a sufficient local boundary for region growth.",I.3.1.d Parallel processing I.3.2.a Distributed/network graphics I.6.9 Visualization Topological Analysis,,"Flow, Topology, and Fields",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9420248.html

We extend recent work on the edit distance and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is strictly equivalent to the L 2 -Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks for geodesics and barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach – with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples – as well as its qualitative ability to generate representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of interest found in the ensemble.

178,A Domain-Oblivious Approach for Learning Concise Representations of Filtered Topological Spaces for Clustering,"Yu Qin, Brittany Terese Fasy, Carola Wenk, Brian Summa","Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.","Topological data analysis, Persistence diagrams, Persistence diagram distances, Learned hashing, Clustering",,"Flow, Topology, and Fields",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1011.html
179,ChartSeer: Interactive Steering Exploratory Visual Analysis with Machine Intelligence,"Jian Zhao, Mingming Fan, Mi Feng","During exploratory visual analysis (EVA), analysts need to continually determine which subsequent activities to perform, such as which data variables to explore or how to present data variables visually. Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer’s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity.","Exploratory visual analysis, interactive steering, visualization recommendation, machine learning",,Grammar and Learning,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9174891.html

While most current deep learning papers contain such visualizations, these are usually handcrafted just before publication, which results in a lack of a common visual grammar, significant time investment, errors, and ambiguities. Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study. It not only reduces the time needed to generate network visualizations for publications, but also enables a unified and unambiguous visualization design.","Neural networks, architecture visualization, graph layouting",,Grammar and Learning,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9350177.html

Gosling balances expressiveness for comprehensive multi-scale genomics data visualizations with accessibility for domain scientists.

The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiation, by further symptom dependency on the prescribed therapy. We describe an integrated environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our visual environment leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution.

  Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner.

In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance.

We have developed a river visualization and a hybrid visualization that combines a scatterplot, a node-link diagram, and a bar chart, to convey the label propagation of graph-based SSL.

The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geo-spatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents.

The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.",,,"Autonomous Driving, Urban, and Spatiotemporal Data",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1480.html

A Visual Analytics Approach to Diagnosing and Improving Semantic Segmentation of Movable Objects,"Wenbin He, Lincan Zou, Shekar Arvind Kumar, Liang Gou, Liu Ren","Semantic segmentation is a critical component in autonomous driving and has to be thoroughly evaluated due to safety concerns. Deep neural network (DNN) based semantic segmentation models are widely used in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to evaluate DNN-based models due to their black-box-like nature, and it is even more difficult to assess model performance for crucial objects, such as lost cargos and pedestrians, in autonomous driving applications. In this work, we propose VASS, a Visual Analytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of Semantic Segmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models’ performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models’ spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VASS via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models’ performance with actionable insights obtained from VASS.",,,"Autonomous Driving, Urban, and Spatiotemporal Data",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1517.html
188,Compass: Towards Better Causal Analysis of Urban Time Series,"Zikun Deng, Di Weng, Xiao Xie, Jie Bao, Yu Zheng, Mingliang Xu, Wei Chen, Yingcai Wu","The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.",,,"Autonomous Driving, Urban, and Spatiotemporal Data",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1181.html

These events implicitly propagate across space and time by following cascading patterns, expanding their influence, and generating event cascades that involve multiple locations. Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges, 1) generalized pattern inference, 2) implicit influence visualization, and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts.","Spatial cascade, pattern mining, spatiotemporal data",,"Autonomous Driving, Urban, and Spatiotemporal Data",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9397369.html

Various works have been presented for querying large spatiotemporal data in real time. However, the real-time query of spatiotemporal data distribution is still an open challenge. As spatiotemporal data become larger, methods of aggregation, storage and querying become critical. We propose a new visual query system that creates a low-memory storage component and provides real-time visual interactions of spatiotemporal data. We first present a peak-based kernel density estimation method to produce the data distribution for the spatiotemporal data. Then a novel density dictionary learning approach is proposed to compress temporal density maps and accelerate the query calculation. Moreover, various intuitive query interactions are presented to interactively gain patterns. The experimental results obtained on three datasets demonstrate that the presented system offers an effective query for visual analytics of spatiotemporal data.",,,"Autonomous Driving, Urban, and Spatiotemporal Data",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1055.html

Current approaches overcome this problem by using focus on specific elements that are then rendered opaque, and carving away all elements occluding their view. In this work, we make use of advanced GPU shader functionality to generate a focus+context rendering that highlights the elements in a selected region and simultaneously conveys the global mesh structure and deformation field. To achieve this, we propose a gradual transition from edge-based focus rendering to volumetric context rendering, by combining fragment shader-based edge and face rendering with per-pixel fragment lists. A fragment shader smoothly transitions between wireframe and face-based rendering, including focus-dependent rendering style and depth-dependent edge thickness and halos, and per-pixel fragment lists are used to blend fragments in correct visibility order. To maintain the global mesh structure in the context regions, we propose a new method to construct a sheet-based level-of-detail hierarchy and smoothly blend it with volumetric information. The user guides the exploration process by moving a lens-like hotspot. Since all operations are performed on the GPU, interactive frame rates are achieved even for large meshes.","Visualization of Hex-Meshes, Real-Time Rendering, GPUs",,Scalability and Rendering,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9409710.html

We have tailored the approach to volume rendering by enforcing a constant memory footprint via analytic inversion of the blending functions. This makes it independent of the number of sampling steps through the volume and facilitates the consideration of small-scale changes. The approach forms the basis for automatic optimizations regarding external parameters of the rendering process and the volumetric density field itself. We demonstrate its use for automatic viewpoint selection using differentiable entropy as objective, and for optimizing a transfer function from rendered images of a given volume. Optimization of per-voxel densities is addressed in two different ways: First, we mimic inverse tomography and optimize a 3D density field from images using an absorption model. This simplification enables comparisons with algebraic reconstruction techniques and state-of-the-art differentiable path tracers. Second, we introduce a novel approach for tomographic reconstruction from images using an emission-absorption model with post-shading via an arbitrary transfer function.",,,Scalability and Rendering,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1136.html

Specifically, we demonstrate how to use these units to accelerate the point location of general unstructured elements consisting of both planar and bilinear faces. This unstructured mesh point location problem has previously been challenging to accelerate on GPU architectures; yet, the performance of these queries is crucial to many unstructured volume rendering and compute applications. Starting with a CUDA reference method, we describe and evaluate three approaches that reformulate these point queries to incrementally map algorithmic complexity to these new hardware ray tracing units. Each variant replaces the simpler problem of point queries with a more complex one of ray queries. Initial variants exploit ray tracing cores for accelerated BVH traversal, and subsequent variants use ray-triangle intersections and per-face metadata to detect point-in-element intersections. Although these later variants are more algorithmically complex, they are significantly faster than the reference method thanks to hardware acceleration. Using our approach, we improve the performance of an unstructured volume renderer by up to 4× for tetrahedral meshes and up to 15× for general bilinear element meshes, matching, or out-performing state-of-the-art solutions while simultaneously improving on robustness and ease-of-implementation.","Scientific Ray Tracing, Unstructured Dcalar Data, GPGPU, Simulation, Volume Rendering",,Scalability and Rendering,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9286513.html

Although it is impossible to super-sample all particles of large-scale data at interactive rates, efficient occlusion culling can decouple the overall data size from a high effective sampling rate of visible particles. However, while the latter is essential for domain scientists to be able to see important data features, performing occlusion culling by sampling or sorting the data is usually slow or error-prone due to visibility estimates of insufficient quality. We present a novel probabilistic culling architecture for super-sampled high-quality rendering of large particle data. Occlusion is dynamically determined at the sub-pixel level, without explicit visibility sorting or data simplification. We introduce confidence maps to probabilistically estimate confidence in the visibility data gathered so far. This enables progressive, confidence-based culling, helping to avoid wrong visibility decisions. In this way, we determine particle visibility with high accuracy, although only a small part of the data set is sampled. This enables extensive super-sampling of (partially) visible particles for high rendering quality, at a fraction of the cost of sampling all particles. For real-time performance with millions of particles, we exploit novel features of recent GPU architectures to group particles into two hierarchy levels, combining fine-grained culling with high frame rates.",,,Scalability and Rendering,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1586.html

We describe a memory-optimized encoding for large unstructured meshes that efficiently encodes both the unstructured mesh and corresponding sample reconstruction acceleration structure, while still allowing for fast random-access sampling as required for rendering.

In scenarios with no or very little labeled data, visual inspection of the predictions is required. Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation. We found that users outperform traditional automated approaches when estimating a model's accuracy.

204,Towards a Survey on Static and Dynamic Hypergraph Visualizations,"Maximilian T. Fischer, Alexander Frings, Daniel Keim, Daniel Seebacher","Leveraging hypergraph structures to model advanced processes has gained much attention over the last few years in many areas, ranging from protein-interaction in computational biology to image retrieval using machine learning. Hypergraph models can provide a more accurate representation of the underlying processes while reducing the overall number of links compared to regular representations. However, interactive visualization methods for hypergraphs and hypergraph-based models have rarely been explored or systematically analyzed. This paper reviews the existing research landscape for hypergraph and hypergraph model visualizations and assesses the currently employed techniques. We provide an overview and a categorization of proposed approaches, focusing on performance, scalability, interaction support, successful evaluation, and the ability to represent different underlying data structures, including a recent demand for a temporal representation of interaction networks and their improvements beyond graph-based methods. Lastly, we discuss the different strengths and weaknesses of the individual approaches and give an insight into the future challenges arising in this emerging research field.","Social Science, Education, Humanities, Journalism, Intelligence Analysis, Knowledge Work, State-of-the-art Survey, Graph/Network and Tree Data",,"Graphs, Charts, and Perception",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1012.html

In this paper, we work closely with the constructors of a new dataset, CGED-Q (China Government Employee Database-Qing), that records the career trajectories of over 340,000 government officials in the Qing bureaucracy in China from 1760 to 1912. We use these data to study career mobility from a historical perspective and understand social mobility and inequality. However, existing statistical approaches are inadequate for analyzing career mobility in this historical dataset with its fine-grained attributes and long time span, since they are mostly hypothesis-driven and require substantial effort. We propose CareerLens, an interactive visual analytics system for assisting experts in exploring, understanding, and reasoning from historical career data. With CareerLens, experts examine mobility patterns in three levels-of-detail, namely, the macro-level providing a summary of overall mobility, the meso-level extracting latent group mobility patterns, and the micro-level revealing social relationships of individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of CareerLens through two case studies and receive encouraging feedback from follow-up interviews with domain experts","Digital Humanities, Quantitative History, Career Mobility, Visual Analytics",,Time Series and Events,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9382844.html

Yet, little has been done to support interactive exploration of large-scale time-series data, which requires a clutter-free visual representation with low-latency interactions. In this paper, we contribute a novel line-segment-based KD-tree method to enable interactive analysis of many time series. Our method enables not only fast queries over time series in selected regions of interest but also a line splatting method for efficient computation of the density field and selection of representative lines. Further, we develop KD-Box, an interactive system that provides rich interactions, e.g., timebox, attribute filtering, and coordinated multiple views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-Box in supporting efficient line query and density field computation through a quantitative comparison and show its usefulness for interactive visual analysis on several real-world datasets.",,,Time Series and Events,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1433.html

We propose a technique to build and explore a multilevel overview of event sequences, from coarse to fine vertical or horizontal level-of-detail, using hierarchical aggregation and a novel cluster data representation Align-Score-Simplify. By default, the overview shows an optimal number of sequence clusters obtained through the average silhouette width metric – then users are able to explore alternative optimal sequence clusterings. The vertical level-of-detail of the overview changes along with the number of clusters, whilst the horizontal level-of-detail refers to the level of summarization applied to each cluster representation. The proposed technique has been implemented into a visualization system called Sequence Cluster Explorer (Sequen-C) that allows multilevel and detail-on-demand exploration through three coordinated views, and the inspection of data attributes at cluster, unique sequence, and individual sequence level. We present two case studies using real-world datasets in the healthcare domain: CUREd and MIMIC-III, which demonstrate how the technique can aid users in exploring and defining a set of distinct pathways that best summarize the dataset, while also being able of identifying deviating pathways and exploring data attributes for selected patterns.",,,Time Series and Events,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1116.html

However, the large number of variables and varying time scales of antecedent conditions contributing to natural phenomena hinder scientists from completing more than the most basic analyses. In this paper, we present EVis (Environmental Visualization), a new visual analytics prototype to help scientists analyze and explore recurring environmental events (e.g. rock fracture, landslides, heat waves, floods) and their relationships with high dimensional time series of continuous numeric environmental variables, such as ambient temperature and precipitation. EVis provides coordinated scatterplots, heatmaps, histograms, and RadViz for foundational analyses. These features allow users to interactively examine relationships between events and one, two, three, or more environmental variables. EVis also provides a novel visual analytics approach to allowing users to discover temporally lagging relationships related to antecedent conditions between events and multiple variables, a critical task in Earth sciences. In particular, this latter approach projects multivariate time series onto trajectories in a 2D space using RadViz, and clusters the trajectories for temporal pattern discovery. Our case studies with rock cracking data and interviews with domain experts from a range of sub-disciplines within Earth sciences illustrate the extensive applicability and usefulness of EVis.",,,Time Series and Events,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1287.html

Instructors who extensively use well-organized and well-argued materials (e.g., textbooks and online resources) can lead students to a narrow perspective in understanding history and prevent spontaneous investigation of historical events, with the students asking their own questions. In this work, we proposed HisVA, a visual analytics system that allows the efficient exploration of historical events from Wikipedia using three views: event, map, and resource. HisVA provides an effective event exploration space, where users can investigate relationships among historical events by reviewing and linking them in terms of space and time.

In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.","Time-varying data visualization, deep learning, super-resolution, generative adversarial network",,Time Series and Events,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9229162.html
211,"Left, Right, and Gender: Exploring Interaction Traces to Mitigate Human Biases","Emily Wall, Arpit Narechania, Adam Coscia, Jamal Paden, Alex Endert","Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental “shortcuts”). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user’s interaction history (i.e., which data points a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one’s analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (e.g., by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (e.g., by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where e.g. gender bias or political party bias may drive one’s analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.",,,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1148.html

They are a testbed for learning high-level reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state-of-the-art neural models --- attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields, machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA, which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.",,,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1583.html
213,The Weighted Average Illusion: Biases in Perceived Mean Position in Scatterplots,"Matt-Heun Hong, Jessica Witt, Danielle Albers Szafir","Scatterplots can encode a third dimension by using additional channels like size or color (e.g. bubble charts). We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the weighted average illusion, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer’s choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misjudgments like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.",,,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1730.html
214,Impact of Cognitive Biases on Progressive Visualization,"Marianne Procopio, Ab Mosca, Carlos Scheidegger, Eugene Wu, Remco Chang","Progressive visualization is fast becoming a technique in the visualization community to help users interact with large amounts of data. With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.","Data visualization, Uncertainty, Bars, Task analysis, Real-time systems, Query processing, Data analysis",,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9320596.html
215,Improving Visualization Interpretation Using Counterfactuals,"Smiti Kaul, David Borland, Nan Cao, David Gotz","Complex, high-dimensional data is used in a wide range of domains to explore problems and make decisions. Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes counterfactual subsets to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.",,,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1010.html
216,Lumos: Increasing Awareness of Analytic Behavior during Visual Data Analysis,"Arpit Narechania, Adam Coscia, Emily Wall, Alex Endert","Visual data analysis tools provide people with the agency and flexibility to explore data using a variety of interactive functionality. However, this flexibility may introduce potential consequences in situations where users unknowingly overemphasize or underemphasize specific subsets of the data or attribute space they are analyzing. For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.",,,Mitigating Bias,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1017.html

Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts.","Graph drawing, Voronoi tessellation, multi-level, spatially-efficient layout",,Graphs and Trees,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9262073.html

One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones. In this paper, we propose a visual analysis system, MissBiN, to involve analysts in the loop for making sense of link prediction results. MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole. We also provide a comprehensive usage scenario to illustrate the usefulness of the tool in an application of intelligence analysis.","Missing link prediction, bipartite network, bi-clique, interactive visualization, visual analytics.",,Graphs and Trees,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9237128.html

In this paper, we focus on the collection of tasks for tree visualizations, a common visual encoding in many domains ranging from biology to computer science to geography. In spite of their commonality, no prior efforts exist to collect and abstractly define tree visualization tasks. We present a literature review of tree visualization papers and generate a curated dataset of over 200 tasks. To enable effective task abstraction for trees, we also contribute a novel extension of the Multi-Level Task Typology to include more specificity to support tree-specific tasks as well as a systematic procedure to conduct task abstractions for tree visualizations. All tasks in the dataset were abstracted with the novel typology extension and analyzed to gain a better understanding of the state of tree visualizations. These abstracted tasks can benefit visualization researchers and practitioners as they design evaluation studies or compare their analytical tasks with ones previously studied in the literature to make informed decisions about their design.

220,Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach,"Markus Wallinger, Daniel Archambault, David Auber, Martin Nöllenburg, Jaakko Peltonen","Edge bundling techniques cluster edges with similar attributes (i.e. similarity in direction and proximity) together to reduce the visual clutter. All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, edge-path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of edge-path bundling over other techniques.",,,Graphs and Trees,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1368.html
221,STRATISFIMAL LAYOUT: A Modular Optimization Model for Laying Out Layered Node-link Network Visualizations,"Sara Di Bartolomeo, Mirek Riedewald, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, Cody Dunne","Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing layered layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a layout optimization model that prioritizes optimality (as compared to scalability) because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing Stratisfimal Layout, a modular integer-linear-programming formulation that can consider several important readability criteria simultaneously: crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices.

222,Interactive Visual Pattern Search on Graph Data via Graph Representation Learning,"Huan Song, Zeng Dai, Panpan Xu, Liu Ren","Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure to model processes and relations in a wide range of domains. Examples include social networks, knowledge graphs, control-flow graphs in programs, and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns (or motifs) in graphs is one important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system, GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. Our approach goes beyond a predefined set of motifs and allows users to interactively specify the patterns of interest. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode the topological and node attributes in a graph as fixed-length
  latent vector representations, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondence in the matching results, which is crucial for visualization and
  interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios in different application domains: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%–29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100x speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness of GraphQ for both usage scenarios.",,,Graphs and Trees,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1494.html

A principal approach taken by researchers is identifying an optimal scheme for water pump controls through examining computational simulations of WDSs. However, due to a large number of possible control combinations and the complexity of WDS simulations, it remains non-trivial to identify the best pump controls by reviewing the simulation results. To address this problem, we design a visual analytics system that helps understand relationships between simulation inputs and outputs towards better optimization. Our system incorporates interpretable machine learning as well as multiple linked visualizations to capture essential input-output relationships from complex WDS simulations. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness through a practical case study and evaluate its usability through expert reviews.

This paper describes CellProfiler Analyst Web (CPAW), a newly redesigned and web-based version of the software, allowing for greater accessibility, quicker setup, and facilitates a simple overall workflow for users. Installation and managing new versions has been challenging and time-consuming, historically, for CellProfiler Analyst. CPAW is an alternative that ensures installation and future updates are not a hassle to the user. CPAW ports the core iteration loop of CPA to a pure server-less browser environment using modern web-development technologies, allowing computationally heavy activities, like machine learning, to occur without freezing the UI. With a setup as simple as navigating to a website, CPAW presents a clean user interface to the user to refine their classifier and explore phenotypic data with ease. We evaluated both the old and the new version of the software in an extensive domain expert study. We found that users could complete the essential classification tasks in CPAW and CPA 3.0 with the same efficiency. Additionally, users completed the tasks 20 percent faster using CPAW compared to CPA 3.0.

AiR visualizes 12 pollutants through the use of unique AR generated particles and chemical models. We demonstrate our application on pollution data by CPCB from various weather stations across India collected over the initial lockdown period due to COVID-19 in India.","Physical & Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Mobile, AR/VR/Immersive, Specialized Input/Display Hardware, General Public, Software Prototype, Geospatial Data",,Applications,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1139.html

We develop a visualization system, VisKonnect, for analyzing the intertwined lives of historical figures based on the events they participated. The users' query is parsed for identifying named entities and related data is queried from an event knowledge graph.

We conducted an empirical study to understand the effect of visualizing those missing values on participants’ decision-making processes while performing a visual data exploration task. More specifically, our study participants purchased a hypothetical portfolio of stocks based on a data set where some stocks had missing values for attributes such as PE ratio, beta, and EPS. The experiment used scatterplots to communicate the stock data. For one group of participants, stocks with missing values simply were not shown, while the second group saw such stocks depicted with estimated values as points with error bars. We measured participants’ cognitive load involved in decision-making with data with missing values. Our results indicate that their decision-making workflow was different across two conditions.","Uncertainty Visualization, Data Analysis, Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Decision Making, Guidelines, Human-Subjects Qualitative Studies, Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies, Data Type Agnostic",,Applications,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1160.html

The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, there is little systematic and practical guidance for data story creators on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for structured data story creation. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid through analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we propose a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through the story creation process. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. The results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid.",,,Data-Driven Communication and Storytelling,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1301.html

However, how to design affective data stories remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate one specific design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express five positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.",,,Data-Driven Communication and Storytelling,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1072.html
248,Interactive Data Comics,"Zezhong Wang, Hugo Romat, Fanny Chevalier, Nathalie Henry Riche, Dave Murray-Rust, Benjamin Bach","This paper investigates how to make data comics interactive. Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.",,,Data-Driven Communication and Storytelling,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1600.html
249,Declutter and Focus: Empirically Evaluating Design Guidelines for Effective Data Communication,"Kiran Ajani, Elsie Lee, Cindy Xiong, Cole Knaflic, William Kemper, Steven Franconeri","Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks.

250,Showing Data about People: A Design Space of Anthropographics,"Luiz Morais, Yvonne Jansen, Nazareno Andrade, Pierre Dragicevic","When showing data about people, visualization designers and data journalists often use design strategies that presumably help the audience relate to those people. The term anthropographics has been recently coined to refer to this practice and the resulting visualizations. Anthropographics is a rich and growing area, but the work so far has remained scattered. Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research papers. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics.","Anthropographics, Design Space, Empathy, Compassion, Prosocial Behavior",,Data-Driven Communication and Storytelling,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9189859.html

To help a viewer intuitively compare values to quickly generate key takeaways, visualization designers can manipulate how data values are arranged in a chart to afford particular comparisons. Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings. These results provide concrete guidelines for how both human designers and automatic chart recommendation systems can make visualizations that help viewers extract the ``right'' takeaway.",,,Data-Driven Communication and Storytelling,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1376.html
252,Generative Design Inspiration for Glyphs with Diatoms,"Matthew Brehmer, Robert Kosara, Carmen Hull","We introduce Diatoms, a technique that generates design inspiration for glyphs by sampling from palettes of mark shapes, encoding channels, and glyph scaffold shapes. Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers’ reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.",,,Glyphs and Sets,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1064.html

However, the creation of circular glyphs remains a difficult task due to the demand for professional design skills and laborious design processes. This paper presents an interactive authoring tool called GlyphCreator to support the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator can promptly generate a list of design candidates and supports interactive editing on the candidates to satisfy different design requirements. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs from summarizing the relation between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model is able to deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we propose an interface with effective interactions to help users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment and demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through a usage scenario. The effectiveness of GlyphCreator is confirmed through user interviews.",,,Glyphs and Sets,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1590.html

Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training.","Star glyph set, coordinate ordering, reinforcement learning, shape context",,Glyphs and Sets,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9328215.html

The core of our method is a new, efﬁcient set overlay construction algorithm that approximates the optimal set overlay by considering set elements and their non-set neighbors. Thanks to the efﬁciency of the algorithm, interactive editing is achieved, and with intelligent suggestions, users can easily and ﬂexibly edit visualizations through direct manipulations with local adaptations.

  To facilitate insights into set connectivity and to leverage semantic relations between intersections, we propose a fast two-step layout technique for Euler diagrams that are both well-matched and well-formed. 
  Our method conforms to established form guidelines for Euler diagrams regarding semantics, aesthetics, and readability. 
  First, we establish an initial ordering of the data, which we then use to incrementally create a planar, connected, and monotone dual graph representation. 
  In the next step, the graph is transformed into a circular layout that maintains the semantics and yields simple Euler diagrams with smooth curves. 
  When the data cannot be represented by simple diagrams, our algorithm always falls back to a solution that is not well-formed but still well-matched, whereas previous methods often fail to produce expected results. 
  We show the usefulness of our method for visualizing set-typed data using examples from text analysis and infographics.

Taking cues from current tensor visualizations, we adapted glyph-based visualization for stress tensors in 3D space. We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field.","ensors, Stress, Visualization, Three-dimensional displays, Data visualization, Clutter, Solids, 3D stress tensor field, visualization, glyph, glyph placement, virtual reality, user study",,Glyphs and Sets,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-8967163.html

Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difﬁcult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution deﬁned by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability to support uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm we developed to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants’ estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared able to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed.

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities.","data uncertainty, data visualization, implicit error, qualitative study, digital humanities, design study, archaeology",,Uncertainty,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9451614.html
260,Examining Effort in 1D Uncertainty Communication Using Individual Differences in Working Memory and NASA-TLX,"Spencer Castro, Helia Hosseinpour, P. Samuel Quinan, Lace Padilla","As uncertainty visualizations for general audiences become increasingly common, designers must understand the full impact of uncertainty communication techniques on viewers' decision processes. Prior work demonstrates mixed performance outcomes with respect to how individuals make decisions using various visual and textual depictions of uncertainty. Part of the inconsistency across findings may be due to an over-reliance on task accuracy, which cannot, on its own, provide a comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty visualization techniques support reasoning processes. In this work, we advance the debate surrounding the efficacy of modern 1D uncertainty visualizations by conducting converging quantitative and qualitative analyses of both the effort and strategies used by individuals when provided with quantile dotplots, density plots, interval plots, mean plots, and textual descriptions of uncertainty. We utilize two approaches for examining effort across uncertainty communication techniques: a measure of individual differences in working-memory capacity known as an operation span (OSPAN) task and self-reports of perceived workload via the NASA-TLX. The results reveal that both visualization methods and working-memory capacity impact participants' decisions. Specifically, quantile dotplots and density plots (i.e., distributional annotations) result in more accurate judgments than interval plots, textual descriptions of uncertainty, and mean plots (i.e., summary annotations). Additionally, participants' open-ended responses suggest that individuals viewing distributional annotations are more likely to employ a strategy that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into their judgments than those viewing summary annotations. When comparing quantile dotplots to density plots, this work finds that both methods are equally effective for low-working-memory individuals. However, for individuals with high-working-memory capacity, quantile dotplots evoke more accurate responses with less perceived effort. Given these results, we advocate for the inclusion of converging behavioral and subjective workload metrics in addition to accuracy performance to further disambiguate meaningful differences among visualization techniques.",,,Uncertainty,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1696.html
261,Can Visualization Alleviate Dichotomous Thinking? Effects of Visual Representations on the Cliff Effect,"Jouni Helske, Satu Helske, Matthew Cooper, Anders Ynnerman, Lonni Besançon","Common reporting styles for statistical results in scientific articles, such as p-values and confidence intervals (CI), have been reported to be prone to dichotomous interpretations, especially with respect to the null hypothesis significance testing framework. For example when the p-value is small enough or the CIs of the mean effects of a studied drug and a placebo are not overlapping, scientists tend to claim significant differences while often disregarding the magnitudes and absolute differences in the effect sizes. This type of reasoning has been shown to be potentially harmful to science. Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to reduce such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has also been challenged. We ran two experiments on researchers with expertise in statistical analysis to compare several alternative representations of confidence intervals and used Bayesian multilevel models to estimate the effects of the representation styles on differences in researchers' subjective confidence in the results. We also asked the respondents' opinions and preferences in representation styles. Our results suggest that adding visual information to classic CI representation can decrease the tendency towards dichotomous interpretations - measured as the `cliff effect': the sudden drop in confidence around p-value 0.05 - compared with classic CI visualization and textual representation of the CI with p-values.

262,Effect of Uncertainty Visualizations on Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle in Retirement Investment Decisions,"Ryan Wesslen, Alireza Karduni, Doug Markant, Wenwen Dou","For many households, investing for retirement is one of the most significant decisions and is fraught with uncertainty. In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.",,,Uncertainty,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1028.html
263,Visualization Equilibrium,"Paula Kayongo, Glenn Sun, Jason Hartline, Jessica Hullman","In many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions. In these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. We reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings.",,,Uncertainty,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1198.html

Common analysis approaches for time dependent scalar fields identify and track specific features. To give a more general overview of the data, we extend Fuzzy Contour Trees, from the visualization and simultaneous analysis of the topology of multiple scalar fields, to time dependent scalar fields. The resulting time-varying Fuzzy Contour Trees allow the comparison of multiple time steps that are not required to be consecutive. We provide specific interaction and navigation possibilities that allow the exploration of individual time steps and time windows in addition to the behavior of the contour trees over all time steps. To achieve this, we reduce an existing alignment to multiple sub-alignments and adapt the Fuzzy Contour Tree-layout to continuously reflect changes and similarities in the sub-alignments. We apply time-varying Fuzzy Contour Trees to different real-world data sets and demonstrate their usefulness.","Comparison and Similarity, Uncertainty Visualization, Data Analysis, Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Decision Making, Scalar Field Data, Computational Topology-based Techniques",,"Mathematics, Topology, and Rendering",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1030.html

However, existing tet marching techniques do not easily generalize to rays with arbitrary origin and direction required for advanced shading effects or non-convex meshes. Additionally, the memory footprint of these methods may exceed GPU memory limits. Interactive performance and high image quality are opposing goals. Our approach significantly lowers the burden to render unstructured datasets with high image fidelity while maintaining real-time and interactive performance even for large datasets. To this end, we leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to find entry and exit faces for a given ray into a volume and utilize a compact mesh representation to enable the efficient marching of arbitrary rays, thus allowing for advanced shading effects that ultimately yields more convincing and grounded images. Our approach is also robust, supporting both convex and non-convex unstructured meshes. We show that our method achieves interactive rates even with moderately-sized datasets while secondary effects are applied.","Life Sciences, Health, Medicine, Biology, Bioinformatics, Genomics, Physical & Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Graphics Techniques, Specific Computing and Rendering Hardware, Algorithms, Scalar Field Data, Volume Rendering",,"Mathematics, Topology, and Rendering",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1113.html

Their study plays an important role in the design of novel materials. A common yet challenging task in the study is to determine the nature of those electronic transitions, i.e. which subgroups of the molecule are involved in the transition by donating or accepting electrons, followed by an investigation of the variation in the donor-acceptor behavior for different transitions or conformations of the molecules. In this paper, we present a novel approach towards the study of electronic transitions based on the visual analysis of a bivariate field, namely the electron density in the hole and particle Natural Transition Orbital (NTO). The visual analysis focuses on the continuous scatter plots (CSPs) of the bivariate field linked to their spatial domain. The method supports selections in the CSP visualized as fiber surfaces in the spatial domain, the grouping of atoms, and segmentation of the density fields to peel the CSP. This peeling operator is central to the visual analysis process and helps identify donors and acceptors. We study different molecular systems, identifying local excitation and charge transfer excitations to demonstrate the utility of the method.","Physical & Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Application Motivated Visualization, Scalar Field Data, Isosurface Techniques",,"Mathematics, Topology, and Rendering",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1122.html

In this paper, we address the challenge of uncertainty visualization of the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms for uncertain scalar field data sampled on a uniform grid. The visualization of the MS and MC topology cases for uncertain data is challenging due to their exponential nature and a possibility of multiple topology cases per cell of a grid. We propose the topology case count and entropy-based techniques for quantifying uncertainty in the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms when noise in data is modeled with probability distributions. We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques for independent and correlated uncertainty assumptions. We visualize the quantified topological uncertainty via color mapping proportional to uncertainty, as well as with interactive probability queries in the MS case and entropy isosurfaces in the MC case. We demonstrate the utility of our uncertainty quantification framework in identifying the isovalues exhibiting relatively high topological uncertainty. We illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques via results on synthetic, simulation, and hixel datasets.","Uncertainty Visualization, Scalar Field Data, Computational Topology-based Techniques, Isosurface Techniques",,"Mathematics, Topology, and Rendering",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1129.html
269,Intercept Graph: An Interactive Radial Visualization for Comparison of State Changes,"Shaolun Ruan, Yong Wang, Qiang Guan","State change comparison of multiple data items is often necessary in multiple application domains, such as medical science, financial engineering, sociology, etc. Slope graphs and grouped bar charts have been widely used to show a ""before-and-after'' story of different data states and indicate their changes. However, they visualize state changes as either slope or difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Grpah, a novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting and ending states of each data item on two concentric circles and the chord length explicitly encodes the ""state change''. By interactively adjusting the inner circle radius, Intercept Grpah can smoothly filter out the large state changes and magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We conducted case studies through comparing Intercept Grpah with slope graphs and grouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Intercept Grpah.","Mathematical Foundations & Numerical Methods, Other Application Areas, Art & Graphic Design, Data Analysis, Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Decision Making, Perception & Cognition, Interaction Design, Visual Representation Design, Temporal Data",,"Mathematics, Topology, and Rendering",,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-short-1146.html
270,Automatic Y-axis Rescaling in Dynamic Visualizations,"Jacob Fisher, Remco Chang, Eugene Wu","Animated and interactive data visualizations dynamically change the data rendered in a visualization (e.g., bar chart). As the data changes, the y-axis may need to be rescaled as the domain of the data changes. Each axis rescaling potentially improves the readability of the current chart, but may also disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy.They instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments to study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling, the factors that affect its effectiveness. We find that the appropriate rescaling policy is both task- and data-dependent, and we do not find one clear policy choice for all situations.","Computing: Software, Networks, Security, Performance Engr., Distr.

272,Inspecting the Running Process of Horizontal Federated Learning via Visual Analytics,"Quan Li, Xiguang Wei, Huanbin Lin, Yang Liu, Tianjian Chen, Xiaojuan Ma","As a decentralized training approach, horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a machine learning model while keeping personal/private information on local devices. Despite the enhanced performance and efficiency of HFL over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of HFL. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the HFL process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the HFL model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the HFL process. In this study, strictly following the HFL privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the HFL process termed HFLens, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Specifically, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients' information in one or different communication round(s), the identification of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each HFL client. Two case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the HFL process better.","Federated learning, anomaly detection, contribution assessment, visualization",,Model Evaluation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9408377.html

Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an evaluation perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.",,,Model Evaluation,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1199.html
274,Visual Analysis of Hyperproperties for Understanding Model Checking Results,"Tom Horak, Norine Coenen, Niklas Metzger, Christopher Hahn, Tamara Flemisch, Julián Méndez, Dennis Dimov, Bernd Finkbeiner, Raimund Dachselt","Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.",,,Model Evaluation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1113.html
275,FairRankVis: A Visual Analytics Framework for Exploring Algorithmic Fairness in Graph Mining Models,"Tiankai Xie, Yuxin Ma, Jian Kang, Hanghang Tong, Ross Maciejewski","Graph mining is an essential component of recommender systems and search engines. Outputs of graph mining models typically provide a ranked list sorted by each item's relevance or utility. However, recent research has identified issues of algorithmic bias in such models, and new graph mining algorithms have been proposed to correct for bias. 
  As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms. We support both group and individual fairness levels of comparison. Our framework is designed to enable model developers to compare multi-class fairness between algorithms (for example, comparing PageRank with a debiased PageRank algorithm) to assess the impacts of algorithmic debiasing with respect to group and individual fairness.

We survey scenarios where comparing these embedding spaces is useful. From those scenarios, we derive common tasks, introduce visual analysis methods that support these tasks, and combine them into a comprehensive system. One of embComp’s central features are overview visualizations that are based on metrics for measuring differences in the local structure around objects. Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences. Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views. Integrating and connecting all of these components, embComp supports a range of analysis workflows that help understand similarities and differences between embedding spaces. We assess our approach by applying it in several use cases, including understanding corpora differences via word vector embeddings, and understanding algorithmic differences in generating embeddings.","I.6.9.c Information visualization < I.6.9 Visualization < I.6 Simulation, Modeling, and Visualization < I Computing Methodologie, L.3.0.f Human- computer interaction < L.3.0 Integrating touch-based interactions into various domains Assistive technology < L.3, H.5.2 User Interfaces < H.5 Information Interfaces and Representation (HCI) < H Information Technology and Systems",,Model Evaluation,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-tvcg-9301222.html

Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions.

278,Rapid Labels: Point-Feature Labeling on GPU,"Václav Pavlovec, Ladislav Čmolík","Labels, short textual annotations are an important component of data visualizations, illustrations, infographics, and geographical maps. In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself. In other words, the labeling method should provide the result as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a greedy point-feature labeling method running on GPU. In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image. Our measurements indicate that the proposed method is able to position more labels than existing greedy methods that do not evaluate conflicts between the label candidates. At the same time, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in performance. The increase in performance is mainly due to the parallelization and the efficient evaluation of label candidates.",,,Efficient Representation and Layout,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1310.html
279,Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics: Automatic Translation of Interactive SVGs to a Multithread VDOM for Fast Rendering,"Michail Schwab, David Saffo, Nicholas Bond, Shash Sinha, Cody Dunne, Jeff Huang, James Tompkin, Michelle Borkin","The dominant markup language for Web visualizations - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) - is comparatively easy to learn, and is open, accessible, customizable via CSS, and searchable via the DOM, with easy interaction handling and debugging. Because these attributes allow visualization creators to focus on design on implementation details, tools built on top of SVG, such as D3.js, are essential to the visualization community. However, slow SVG rendering can limit designs by effectively capping the number of on-screen data points, and this can force visualization creators to switch to Canvas or WebGL. These are less flexible (e.g., no search or styling via CSS), and harder to learn. We introduce Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics (SSVG) to reduce these limitations and allow complex and smooth visualizations to be created with SVG. SSVG automatically translates interactive SVG visualizations into a dynamic virtual DOM (VDOM) to bypass the browser's slow `to specification' rendering by intercepting JavaScript function calls. De-coupling the SVG visualization specification from SVG rendering, and obtaining a dynamic VDOM, creates flexibility and opportunity for visualization system research. SSVG uses this flexibility to free up the main thread for more interactivity and renders the visualization with Canvas or WebGL on a web worker. Together, these concepts create a drop-in JavaScript library which can improve rendering performance by 3-9X with only one line of code added. To demonstrate applicability, we describe the use of SSVG on multiple example visualizations including published visualization research.

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions.

While its run-time complexity limited it to small datasets in the past, recent efforts improved upon the expensive similarity computations and the previously quadratic minimization. Nevertheless, t-SNE still has high runtime and memory costs when operating on millions of points. We present a novel method for executing the t-SNE minimization. While our method overall retains a linear runtime complexity, we obtain a significant performance increase in the most expensive part of the minimization. We achieve a significant improvement without a noticeable decrease in accuracy even when targeting a 3D embedding. Our method constructs a pair of spatial hierarchies over the embedding, which are simultaneously traversed to approximate many N-body interactions at once.

Although t-SNE has been widely employed to visualize high-dimensional datasets from various domains, it is limited to projecting a single dataset. When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation.

In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views.

Such data offers promising opportunities to better understand the progression of diseases. However, these observations are usually treated as general events in existing visual analysis tools. As a result, their capabilities in modeling disease progression are not fully utilized. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented ThreadStates, an interactive visual analytics tool for the exploration of longitudinal patient cohort data. The focus of ThreadStatesis to identify the states of disease progression by learning from observation data in a human-in-the-loop manner. We propose a novel Glyph Matrix design and combine it with a scatter plot to enable seamless identification, observation, and refinement of states. The disease progression patterns are then revealed in terms of state transitions using Sankey-based visualizations. We employ sequence clustering techniques to find patient groups with distinctive progression patterns, and to reveal the association between disease progression and patient-level features. The design and development were driven by a requirement analysis and iteratively refined based on feedback from domain experts over the course of a 10-month design study.

This is a question a new microscopy-based approach for measuring the mass of individual cancer cells treated with different drugs promises to answer in only a few hours. However, the analysis pipeline for extracting data from these images is still far from complete automation: human intervention is necessary for quality control for preprocessing steps such as segmentation, to adjust filters, and remove noise, and for the analysis of the result. To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates, and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach of choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient.",,,Biological and Medical Visualization,honorable,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1271.html

Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10^9 or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells.

Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.",,,Biological and Medical Visualization,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-full-1502.html
288,Multiscale Unfolding: Illustratively Visualizing the Whole Genome at a Glance,"Sarkis Halladjian, David Kouril, Haichao Miao, Eduard Gröller, Ivan Viola, Tobias Isenberg","We present Multiscale Unfolding, an interactive technique for illustratively visualizing multiple hierarchical scales of DNA in a single view, showing the genome at different scales and demonstrating 
 how one scale spatially folds into the next. The DNA's extremely long sequential structure---arranged differently on several distinct scale levels---is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cut-aways. In contrast to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale representation, while still linearly unfolding the DNA. Inspired by illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent the spatial structure of the whole DNA macro-molecule, maintain its local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to grasp the DNA's structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms, with increasing levels of ""unfoldedness,"" and can be applied in data-driven illustration and communication.","Multiscale visualization, spatially-controlled scale

289,Selective Region-based Photo Color Adjustment for Graphic Designs,"Nanxuan Zhao, Quanlong Zheng, Jing Liao, Ying Cao, Hanspeter Pfister, Rynson W. H. Lau","When adding a photo onto a graphic design, professional graphic designers often adjust its colors based on some target colors obtained from the brand or product to make the entire design more memorable to audiences and establish a consistent brand identity. However, adjusting the colors of a photo in the context of a graphic design is a difficult task, with two major challenges: (1) Locality: The color is often adjusted locally to preserve the semantics and atmosphere of the original image; and (2) Naturalness: The modified region needs to be carefully chosen and recolored to obtain a semantically valid and visually natural result. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based approach to photo color adjustment for graphic designs, which maps an input photo along with the target colors to a recolored result. Our method decomposes the color adjustment process into two successive stages: modifiable region selection and target color propagation. The first stage aims to solve the core, challenging problem of which local image region(s) should be adjusted, which requires not only a common sense of colors appearing in our visual world but also understanding of subtle visual design heuristics. To this end, we capitalize on both natural photos and graphic designs to train a region selection network, which detects the most likely regions to be adjusted to the target colors. The second stage trains a recoloring network to naturally propagate the target colors in the detected regions. Through extensive experiments and a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our selective region-based photo recoloring framework.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-115.html
290,Tracing Versus Freehand for Evaluating Computer-Generated Drawings,"Zeyu Wang, Sherry Qiu, Nicole Feng, Holly Rushmeier, Leonard McMillan, Julie Dorsey","Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) and image processing algorithms are widely assumed as a proxy for drawing. However, this assumption is not well assessed due to the difficulty in collecting and registering freehand drawings. Alternatively, tracings are easier to collect and register, but there is no quantitative evaluation of tracing as a proxy for freehand drawing. In this paper, we compare tracing, freehand drawing, and computer-generated drawing approximation (CGDA) to understand their similarities and differences. We collected a dataset of 1,498 tracings and freehand drawings by 110 participants for 100 image prompts. Our drawings are registered to the prompts and include vector-based timestamped strokes collected via stylus input. Comparing tracing and freehand drawing, we found a high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used over time. We show that tracing can serve as a viable proxy for freehand drawing because of similar correlations between spatio-temporal stroke features and labeled stroke types. Comparing hand-drawn content and current CGDA output, we found that 60% of drawn pixels corresponded to computer-generated pixels on average. The overlap tended to be commonly drawn content, but people's artistic choices and temporal tendencies remained largely uncaptured. We present an initial analysis to inform new CGDA algorithms and drawing applications, and provide the dataset for use by the community.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-332.html
291,A Non-exponential Transmittance Model for Volumetric Scene Representations,"Delio Vicini, Wenzel Jakob, Anton Kaplanyan","We introduce a novel transmittance model to improve the volumetric representation of 3D scenes. The model can represent opaque surfaces in the volumetric light transport framework. Volumetric representations are useful for complex scenes, and become increasingly popular for level of detail and scene reconstruction. The traditional exponential transmittance model found in volumetric light transport cannot capture correlations in visibility across volume elements. When representing opaque surfaces as volumetric density, this leads to both bloating of silhouettes and light leaking artifacts. By introducing a parametric non-exponential transmittance model, we are able to approximate these correlation effects and significantly improve the accuracy of volumetric appearance representation of opaque scenes. Our parametric transmittance model can represent a continuum between the linear transmittance that opaque surfaces exhibit and the traditional exponential transmittance encountered in participating media and unstructured geometries. This covers a large part of the spectrum of geometric structures encountered in complex scenes. In order to handle the spatially varying transmittance correlation effects, we further extend the theory of non-exponential participating media to a heterogeneous transmittance model. Our model is compact in storage and computationally efficient both for evaluation and for reverse-mode gradient computation. Applying our model to optimization algorithms yields significant improvements in volumetric scene appearance quality. We further show improvements for relevant applications, such as scene appearance prefiltering, image-based scene reconstruction using differentiable rendering, neural representations, and compare it to a conventional exponential model.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-322.html
292,Editable Free-viewpoint Video using a Layered Neural Representation,"Jiakai Zhang, Xinhang Liu, Xinyi Ye, Fuqiang Zhao, Yanshun Zhang, Minye Wu, Yingliang Zhang, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu","Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-173.html
293,Pareto Gamuts : exploring optimal designs across varying contexts,"Liane Makatura, Minghao Guo, Adriana Schulz, Justin Solomon, Wojciech Matusik","Manufactured parts are meticulously engineered to perform well with respect to several conflicting metrics, like weight, stress, and cost. The best achievable trade-offs reside on the Pareto front which can be discovered via performance-driven optimization. The objectives that define this Pareto front often incorporate assumptions about the context in which a part will be used, including loading conditions, environmental influences, material properties, or regions that must be preserved to interface with a surrounding assembly. Existing multi-objective optimization tools are only equipped to study one context at a time, so engineers must run independent optimizations for each context of interest. However, engineered parts frequently appear in many contexts: wind turbines must perform well in many wind speeds, and a bracket might be optimized several times with its bolt-holes fixed in different locations on each run. In this paper, we formulate a framework for variable-context multi-objective optimization. We introduce the Pareto gamut, which captures Pareto fronts over a range of contexts. We develop a global/local optimization algorithm to discover the Pareto gamut directly, rather than discovering a single fixed-context ""slice"" at a time. To validate our method, we adapt existing multi-objective optimization benchmarks to contextual scenarios. We also demonstrate the practical utility of Pareto gamut exploration for several engineering design problems.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-153.html
294,NeuMIP: Multi-Resolution Neural Materials,"Alexandr Kuznetsov, Krishna Mullia, Zexi-ang Xu, Miloš Hašan, Ravi Ramamoorthi","We propose NeuMIP, a neural method for representing and rendering a variety of material appearances at different scales. Classical prefiltering (mipmapping) methods work well on simple material properties such as diffuse color, but fail to generalize to normals, self-shadowing, fibers or more complex microstructures and reflectances. In this work, we generalize traditional mipmap pyramids to pyramids of neural textures, combined with a fully connected network. We also introduce neural offsets, a novel method which allows rendering materials with intricate parallax effects without any tessellation. This generalizes classical parallax mapping, but is trained without supervision by any explicit heightfield. Neural materials within our system support a 7-dimensional query, including position, incoming and outgoing direction, and the desired filter kernel size. The materials have small storage (on the order of standard mipmapping except with more texture channels), and can be integrated within common Monte-Carlo path tracing systems. We demonstrate our method on a variety of materials, resulting in complex appearance across levels of detail, with accurate parallax, self-shadowing, and other effects.",,,SIGGRAPH Invited Talks,,,https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2021/paper_v-siggraph-287.html
